<p class="dropcap"><i>As Prefaces now are become common
to every Production of the
Press, I am resolv’d to be in the
Fashion likewise, to let my Reader
understand that I am not an Ascetick,
or one of those devout Pilgrims, who
will travel on Foot to see the holy Sepulchre,
the Chapel of <em class="antiqua">Loretto</em>, or some strange Relique;
but a comical merry Traveller that
would take a Perigrination, on Horseback
or by Water, beyond the <em class="antiqua">Devil</em>’s <em class="antiqua">Arse</em> i’th’
Peak, to see the Religion, Customs, and Manners
of foreign People, as well as knowing
those of my own Country; contrary to the Sentiments
of <em class="antiqua">Claudian</em>, who mentions it as a
Happiness, for Birth, Life, and Burial, to
be all in one Parish.</i></p>

<p><i>Some Pilgrims may brag of their having
seen a Vial full of the Virgin <em class="antiqua">Mary</em>’s Milk;
another Vial full of <em class="antiqua">Mary Magdalen</em>’s repenting
Tears; the Pummel of the Sword with
which the Ear of <em class="antiqua">Malchus</em>, the high Priest’s
Servant, was cut off; the Bill of the Cock
which crow’d after Saint <em class="antiqua">Peter</em> had deny’d his
Master, set in Silver; an Ell <em class="antiqua">Flemish</em> of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
Cord with which <em class="antiqua">Judas</em> hang’d himself; a
Linnen Apron worn by our Saviour’s hæmorrhoidal
Patient; a Piece of the seemless Garment,
for which the <em class="antiqua">Jewish</em> Soldiers cast Lots;
one of Saint <em class="antiqua">John</em> the Baptist’s Eye-Teeth, set
in Gold; Saint <em class="antiqua">Paul</em>’s Cloak, which he left
at <em class="antiqua">Troas</em>, never the worse for wearing; and
talk also of their often meeting with the wandering
<em class="antiqua">Jew</em> in their Travels; these, I say,
were Curiosities I valu’d not seeing; but in all
Places wherever I came, I made general Observations
on the Folly and Vices of the Inhabitants,
thereby to correct my own Manners,
which, indeed, is a very fine Thing, in either
Man or Beast.</i></p>

<p><i>In Order hereto, I have travell’d in three
Parts of the World; namely, <em class="antiqua">Europe</em>, <em class="antiqua">Africa</em>,
and <em class="antiqua">America</em>; and tho’ Wickedness reigns in
all Parts of the World, yet must I needs say,
that it is not so predominate in any Place as
in <em class="antiqua">England</em>, <em class="antiqua">Wales</em>, <em class="antiqua">Scotland</em>, <em class="antiqua">Ireland</em>, and
<em class="antiqua">Holland</em>; where it is as hard to find Religion,
Honesty and Virtue walk Hand in Hand, as
it was for <em class="antiqua">Diogenes</em> to find an honest Woman
in <em class="antiqua">Athens</em>. This Dearth of good Manners
oblig’d me, with the abovesaid Philosopher to
turn <em class="antiqua">Cynick</em>; and if by these Lucubrations,
I can so far put Folly and Vice, out of Countenance,
as to reclaim a wicked Age, it is all
the Author desires for the Fatigue of taking
a Pilgrimage, by Land and Sea, of above
Eleven Thousand Miles, which is more than
half the Circumference of the whole Earth.</i></p>

<p class="dropcap">As <em>London</em> is the Metropolis, or capital
City in the World, for Pride,
Luxury, and all other Vices; I was
very curious of making some Observations
on them. In Order hereto,
I frequented several Taverns,
where was nothing but Drunkenness, and young
Rakes vomiting about the Room, and in their
<em>Bacchanalian</em> Frolicks (which made them think,
with <em>Copernicus</em>, the Earth turn’d round) breaking
Pipes and Glasses, to inflame a great Reckoning
to a larger Sum. I also haunted Jelly-Houses,
where was no other Diversion, than seeing
proud conceited Coxcombs eating Jellies, with a
gilded Pap-Spoon, for Provocation to venerial
Sports; which by lighting on a Fire-Ship, might
bring them to the Charge and Misery of Pills,
Bolusses, Electuaries, and Diet-Drinks; so that
these gallanting Stallions, need no other
Injunction of Penance, from the most rigid Confessor:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
And at every common Gaming-House about
Town, the Gamesters are as lavishing of their Oaths
and Curses, as they are at the Groom Porter’s.
One is cursing the Dice, another biting his Thumbs,
and another scratching where it doth not itch,
whilst others are flourishing their Swords in the
midst of twenty G⸺d⸺s, to have their lost
Money again.</p>

<p>Think I to myself, the frequenting of these
Places, will return to no better Account towards
a Reformation of bad Manners, than if a Man
should go to a Bawdy-House, to keep out of ill
Company. So having heard that a deal of good
Manners and Morality, might be learnt, in seeing
Plays acted on the <em>English</em> Stage; I then flung away
many a Half Crown at the Theatres in <em>Bridges-Street</em>,
and <em>Lincoln’s Inn Fields</em>, but by the immoral,
profane, and impious Expressions us’d in the
dramatick Writings, whether tragical or comical,
I could reckon the Play-Houses, no other than
Schools of Iniquity, the Sinks of all Wickedness,
and Markets for the Devil. ’Tis out of doubt,
that even the Theatres of <em>Greece</em> and <em>Rome</em>, under
Heathenism, were less obnoxious and offensive,
yet nevertheless they stood condemn’d by the
primitive Fathers, and general Councils.</p>

<p>The detestable lewd Expressions in the <em>English</em>
Plays, can do no less than debauch the Minds,
and corrupt the Manners of the Audience; but
it must needs strike every good <em>Christian</em> with
Horror, to hear on the Stage Almighty God
blasphem’d, his Providence question’d and deny’d,
his Name prophan’d, his Attributes ascrib’d to sinful
Creatures, and even to heathen Gods, his
holy Word burlesqu’d, and treated as a Fable,
his Grace made a Jest of, his Ministers despis’d,
Conscience laugh’d at, Religion ridicul’d, the Catholick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
Faith and Doctrine expos’d, the sincere
Practice of Religion, represented as the Effect of
Vapours and Melancholly, Virtue discountenanc’d,
Vice encourag’d, Evil treated as Good, and Good
as Evil; and all this highly aggravated, by being
done in cool Blood, upon Choice and Deliberation.</p>

<p>The Infidelity and Loosness of the present Age,
is very much owing to the Play-Houses, where
the Infection of most abominable Wickedness,
spreads among the Spectators, from the Lady in
the Front or Side-Box, to the tawdry Chambermaid
in upper Gallery. Men and Women who
frequent the Theatre, are, instead of learning
Virtue, surrounded with inordinate Temptations,
which incite them to unlawful Desires and Actions,
which soon end in the utter Ruin, both of Body
and Soul. Where Lewdness is represented, in all
the Dresses that can vitiate the Imagination, and
fasten upon the Memory; and where Pride and
Falshood, Malice and Revenge, Injustice and
Immodesty, Contempt of Marriage, and false
Notions of Honour are recommended, no Good
can be learn’d, either by old or young; and this
not among <em>Mahometans</em> and <em>Infidels</em>, not at <em>Rome</em>
and <em>Venice</em>, not in <em>France</em> and <em>Spain</em>, but in a <em>Protestant</em>
Country, and upon the <em>English</em> Stage, without
any Fear that the Judgments of God will fall
upon them. The <em>Players</em> exposing (as they pretend
they do) Formality, Humour, and Pedantry, is
not an equivalent for their insulting sacred Things,
and their promoting to so high a Degree, the Prophaneness
and Debauchery of the Nation.</p>

<p>Those who frequent the Play-House, say (to
palliate the sin) a great deal of Morality is to
be learnt from Plays; but I cannot perceive
what good Morals can be obtained from such
Expressions as these. “Sure, if Woman had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
ready created, the Devil, instead of being kickt
down to Hell, had been married. <em>Leonora</em>’s
Charms turn Vice to Virtue, Treason into
Truth; Nature, who has made her the supreme
Object of our Desires, must needs have
design’d her the Regulater of our Morals. She’s
mad with the Whimsies of Virtue, and the Devil.
Damn’d Lies, by <em>Jupiter</em> and <em>Juno</em>, and
the rest of the Heathen Gods and Goddesses;
for I remember I paid two Guineas for swearing
<em>Christian</em> Oaths last Night.” As may be seen
in several of the comick Writers. However,
the Admirers of the Stage must have some Excuse
for their Folly, and thus the Devil too, to support
Vice, hangs out the Colours of Virtue. Again,
we cannot see what Morality can be learnt in,
there Expressions in the following Tragedies of
<em>Œdipus</em> and <em>Theodosius</em>.</p>

<p>In which Lines abovesaid may be seen the Lover
pursuing his Amours in Defiance of Heaven;
and <em>Varanes</em> dying a natural Death, or else he had
been so wicked, as to have laid violent hands on
himself. Neither are the <em>Greek</em> and <em>Latin</em> Dramatists
without their prophane Flights, and wicked
Rants: Nay, hear how <em>Augustin</em>, that great Father
of the Church, in these Words, <em>Non omnino
per hanc turpitudinem verba ista commodius discuntur,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
sed per hæc verba turpitudo ista confidentius perpetratur</em>.
Confes. lib. 1. cap. 16. condemns the following
Lines of <em>Terence</em>’s Eunuch, Act 3. Scene 5.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Suspectans tabulam quandam pictam, ubi inerat pictura hæc, Jovem</div>

<div class="verse">Egomet quoque id spectare cœpi, &amp;c.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In short, no good Manners can be acquir’d on
the <em>English</em> Stage, by seeing an Actor going a Tiptoe,
in Derision of mincing Dames; sometimes
speaking full-mouth’d, to mock the Country
Clowns; and sometimes upon the Tip of the
Tongue, to scoff the Citizen? that thus, by the Imitation
of all ridiculous Gestures, or Speeches, in
all Kinds of Vocations, they may provoke Laughter.
When Stages were first set up in <em>Rome</em>, it
was accounted infamous to frequent them; and
in <em>England</em>, Players, both Men and Women, are
reckon’d so scandalous, that tho’ they stile themselves
his Majesty’s Servants, yet the Statute
Law terms them Vagabonds: “Indeed they are
so infamously wicked, that one who never saw
them in this Life, may nevertheless at the Resurrection,
know their Bodies and Souls are Fellows;
insomuch that as the Play-House in <em>Drury-Lane</em>
has been burnt once already, it would
be a Mercy rather than a Judgment, if God
vouchsafed to smite them once again.”</p>

<p>The Audience in the Upper-Gallery is generally
compos’d of Lawyers Clerks, Valets de Chambre,
Exchange-Girls, Chamber-Maids, and Skip-kennels,
who at the last Act are let in <em>gratis</em>, in
Favour to their Masters being Benefactors to the
Devil’s Servants. The Middle-Gallery is taken up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
by the midling Sort of People, as Citizens, their
Wives, and Daughters, and other Jilts, who make
it their Business to let out their Commodities in
Fee-tail, to the first Cully she picks up, after
Play is over, for a small Treat, and twelve Pence
dry. The Boxes are fill’d with Lords and Ladies,
who give Money to see their Follies expos’d
by Fellows as wicked as themselves. And the
Pit, which lively represents the Pit of Hell, is
cramm’d with those insignificant Animals called
Beaux, whose Character nothing but Wonder
and Shame can compose; for a modern Beaux
(you must know) is a pretty neat, phantastical
Outside of a Man; a well digested Bundle of
costly Vanities; and you may call him a Volume
of methodical Errata’s bound in a gilt Cover.
He’s a curiously wrought Cabinet full of
Shells and other Trumpery, which were much better
quite empty, than so emptily full. He’s a
Man’s Skin full of Prophaness, a Paradise full of
Weeds; a Heaven cramm’d full of Devils, or
<em>Satan</em>’s Bed-Chamber, hung with Arras of God’s
own making. He can be thought no better than
a <em>Promethean</em> Man; at best but a Lump of animated
Dirt kneaded into Humane Shape; and if
he has any such Thing as a Soul, it seems to be
patch’d up with more Vices than are Patches in
a poor <em>Spaniard</em>’s Cloak. His general Employment
is to scorn all Business, but the Study of
the Modes and Vices of the Times; and you may
look upon him as upon the painted Sign of a man
hung up in the Air, only to be toss’d to and fro
with every Wind of Temptation and Vanity.
As for his Apparel, he endeavours to that all
should appear new about him, except his Vices
and Religion; he’s too much in Love with these
to change them; besides, the latter of them he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
cannot change, because he never had any.
When you look upon his Cloaths, you will be
apt to say, he wears his Heaven upon his Back;
and truly (’tis much to be fear’d) you see as much
of it there, as He ever shall. He is trick’d up in
such Gauderies, as if he was resolv’d to make his
Body a Lure for the Devil; and with this Bravery
would make a Bait should tempt the Tempter
to fall in Love with him. By this Variety
of Fashions he goes nigh to cheat his Creditors;
who for this Reason, dare never swear him to be
the same Man they formerly had to deal withal.
His Draper may very well be afraid to lose him
in a Labyrinth of his own Cloth, which fits, or
hangs (shall I say?) for the most part so loosely
about him, as if it were ever ready to fly away,
for Fear of a Bailiff.</p>

<p>His Language and Discourse are altogether suitable
to his Garb and Habit, all affected and apish,
but indeed, far more vile, sinful, and abominable.
When he talks, why then his Time-observing
Hand and Foot do so point, accent, and adorn
all his phantastick Flourishes, that his Words are
often as much lost in his Actions, as his Sense
in his Words: Withal using foolish Expressions, as
stab my Vitals, run me through the <em>Diaphragma</em>,
pasitively (not positively) it is so and so; speaking
as effeminately, and Molly-like, as the <em>Ischnotes</em>,
who say, as you may see in <em>Lilly</em>’s Grammar,
<em>Nync</em> for <em>Nunc</em>, <em>Tync</em> for <em>Tunc</em>. By Degrees
he steps from Idleness and Emptiness, Foolery
and Drollery, to Scurrility and Obloquy; so that
if his black Breath could blow out, or eclipse
those Lights that shine brightest, we should not
have one Star left in Virtue’s Heaven; and those
Lights which were once sent into the World, to

he first endeavours to extinguish, that so he
may, without Check or Shame, wander thro’ all
the Works of Darkness into Hell. Alas! he sees
no such Loveliness in the Things above, as may
oblige him to the submissive Courtship of saying
his Prayers below; and yet is so confident to
enjoy Heaven at last; as if he thought God would
be beholden to him for accepting his Blessings;
or (as some foolish Lovers take Occasion to double
their Addresses from the Unkindness of a coy
Mistress) God would the more earnestly importune
him to be sav’d, the more disdainfully he
looks upon Salvation. If ever he appears at
Church, it is but to meditate upon the Ladies, as
they sit in their Sunday’s Beauties; and then he
returns from the House of God, as most who go
thither with no better Intentions, nay ten Times
more an <em>Athiest</em> than he went.</p>

<p>The Theatre in the <em>Hay-Market</em> is his sole
Delight, where half a Guinea is given for an
<em>Italian</em> Song, sung in a new Opera by some foreign
Eunuch, or Jilt, with such Quivering, that
the Words are lost and confounded with more affected
Noise than Harmony. Or else he passes
his Time away (as above hinted) at the Play-Houses
in <em>Drury-Lane</em>, or <em>Lincoln’s-Inn Fields</em>, to
ogle an impudent Actress, or some female Dancer,
who crane’s her Neck with such various Motions,
that one would think she was going to break it
without the Assistance of a Hangman. Or if he is
not at these Places of Pollution and Wickedness,
the Tavern he then makes his Exchange; where
he endeavours to drink himself so far into a
Beast, as if it was his Design to become thereby
incapable of Damnation, except he be forc’d to
sleep out the last Night’s Intemperance; and
thinks himself a Champion, when he can kick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
two down Stairs at once, the Drawer and his Bottle;
and sound the Alarm to the Skirmish, in a
loud Peal of new-fashion’d Curses. After all is
done there, he walks the Streets as light in his
Head, as his Purse; and much oftner salutes the
Pavement than the Passengers. The Beau hates
no Name so much as that of a <em>Christian</em>, he is afraid
it would make him melancholy: He travels
over the wide World of Sin, till he hath as little
Money as Religion, and no more Credit than Money;
whereby he is usually at last constrain’d
either to lie hid, and so become his own Prisoner,
or to pawn his Body to the Marshal of the
<em>King’s Bench</em> Prison in <em>Southwark</em>, or the Warden
of the <em>Fleet</em>, for his Chamber; or else, to become
a Citizen of the World, and so at last is every
where at Home, because he is indeed at Home
no where. In fine, I never saw an affected Beau
have any Bravery; which makes me think they
are related to a certain Attorney, who once resenting
my sending an affronting Letter to his Sweetheart,
had not the Courage to draw his Tilter,
when I <em>ex tempore</em> spoke to him the following
Lines:</p>

for going to <em>Deptford</em>, I perceiv’d as much Drunkenness
among the <em>Tarpaulins</em>, as among the Admirers
of <em>Geneva</em>, at the <em>Frenchman</em>’s Bob-Shop,
or <em>dirty-Face Dick</em> in the <em>Strand</em>; but however,
the <em>Tarpaulin</em>’s Froes of this Place, as well as at
<em>Wapping, are pretty virtuous, thro’ their Husband</em>’s
<em>making them go without Smocks, to prevent their
Neighbours from taking up their Wives Linnen</em>. From
hence, I went to <em>Greenwich-Park</em>, where I found
as many Assignations made betwixt Whore and
Cully, as in <em>St. James</em>’s, or <em>Hyde-Park</em>. Here was
as much Lying by the Fops in Praise of their Mistresses,
as is among Lawyers; as much Flattering,
as there is at Court; and as much Dissembling,
as in a <em>Presbyterian</em> or <em>Anabaptist</em> Meeting-House;
a Folly, which I must own, I have been
formerly guilty of myself, when I sent to a
young Gentlewoman this amorous Petition, for
Flattery is the only Bait to decoy the coyest
Virgin in <em>England</em>.</p>

<p>But being soon tir’d of <em>Greenwich</em>, I proceeded
on my Pilgrimage to <em>Gravesend</em>, where, (and at
<em>Stroud</em>, <em>Rochester</em>, and <em>Chatham</em>) the Vintners, Innkeepers,
and Victuallers, are more extortioning
than any Pawn-Broker, who has the Honesty to
take no more than <em>Cent. per Cent.</em> for what Money
they lend. Hereupon, bidding adieu to the
County of <em>Kent</em>, I rambled through the County
of <em>Surry</em>; but it being Assize-Time when I arriv’d<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
at <em>Kingston</em> upon <em>Thames</em>, I found I was
leap’d out of the Fryingpan into the Fire, for
Provisions and Lodging were then as dear as a
Suit of Law in <em>Chancery</em>; so that I rid forthwith
into the County of <em>Sussex</em>, where I saw nothing
but a Parcel of Bumpkins and Milk-Wenches
returning all home, as drunk as <em>David</em>’s sow,
from a Country-Wake. Thence, I went into
<em>Hampshire</em>, where Rusticks are as fat as their
Hogs and as liquorish as those who buy their
Honey. In this County is <em>Southampton</em>, where
the Sword of Sir <em>Bevis</em> is held in as much Veneration
by the Towns People, as a Piece of Paper
worn by ’Prentice-Boys, and Servant-Wenches on
<em>Valentine</em>’s Day. Hence, I went to <em>Portsmouth</em>, betwixt
which Place and Hell, the Soldiers garrison’d
here say, there is but only a Sheet of brown
Paper; however, it is honour’d by giving the
Title of a Dutchess to <em>Squintabella</em>, <em>alias</em> Madamoiselle
<em>Louise de Querouaille</em>. At this Sea-port,
crossing the Water, I reached at the Distance of
three Leagues, the <em>Isle of Wight</em>, and proceeded
to <em>Carisbrook</em> Castle, which inwardly, (as well
as outwardly) is much out of Repair, especially
the Room in which King <em>Charles</em> I. was confin’d
a Prisoner, a little before the horrid Murder
perpetrated on him, the then prevailing Party,
who under a Stratocracy or Army-Power,
brought him to the Block, and then conspir’d
to overthrow the well settled Constitution of
this Kingdom with Anarchy, and Confusion
which unparalleled Piece of Villany incited me
to write <em>ex tempore</em> on the Wall of that fatal
Place, the following Lines.</p>

<div class="verse">Where Majesty in Mourning sat, to wait</div>

<div class="verse">Our Calendars shall ever die with Red;</div>
<div class="verse">To paint the Overthrow of th’ Church and State,</div>

<div class="verse">But now the injur’d Saint in Peace does dwell,</div>
<div class="verse">While those that judg’d him, burning are in Hell.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Getting cross the Water again, from this dismal
Isle, I no sooner set Foot upon <em>Terra firma</em>,
but I made the best of my Way for <em>Berkshire</em>;
where I took a Survey of <em>Windsor</em> Castle, and then
thought myself as well Qualify’d as any Knight
of the Garter, to take a Pilgrimage whither I
pleas’d: So with a full Body, and an empty Stomach,
(for you must know, we Pilgrims live not
very daintily) I went into <em>Wiltshire</em>, where I as
much admired the Cathedral of <em>Salisbury</em>, (as an
Antiquary, doth an old Tomb; who will go forty
Miles, and more to see it) because it contain’d
as many Windows about it, as a <em>German</em> Countess
did once Children in her Womb, which were just
three hundred sixty five, the precise Number of
Days in the Year, unless it happens to be <em>Bissextile</em>
or Leap-Year, which has one Day more.
Hence, I went with a light Heart, and a thin Pair<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
of Breeches into <em>Dorsetshire</em>; where being nothing
remarkable to take Notice of, it came into my
Noddle to make the following Acrostick on Nothing.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">N othing was the first Matter made the World;</div>
<div class="verse">O n Man e’er since nothing but Plagues are hurl’d.</div>
<div class="verse">T he Tye of Wedlock’s nothing but a Snare:</div>
<div class="verse">H onour’s like nothing but the empty Air.</div>
<div class="verse"><em class="antiqua">I rishmen</em> are nothing but Fools void of Sense</div>
<div class="verse">N othing is Sin but publick Insolence.</div>
<div class="verse">G old! Gold! and nothing else quits the Offence.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Next, I went a pilgramaging into <em>Devonshire</em>,
which might be properly call’d <em>Devilshire</em>, for seeing
how the Inhabitants would eat White-Pots red
hot in a Manner, a Stranger would be apt to conclude,
they came from whence they have nothing
else for their Food but Brimstone and Fire. Hereupon,
I galloped strait into <em>Cornwal</em>, a County very
plentiful of Wood-Cocks, not only flying in
the Air, but you should also see them smoaking
or tipling in every Chimney-Corner, in Winter.
Thence, I rambled into <em>Somersetshire</em>, where, at the
<em>Bath</em>, I saw so much Whoredom committed, that
I thought the Men, or Women neither had Occasion
to wash themselves in hot Water, when their Bodies
were all on Fire before; unless it was to
make an Experiment of that Aphorism in Physick,
which says, one Heat drives out another.
Not liking this Place, I took a Pilgrimage (I can’t
say Tour, or Progress, because Pilgrims are not
Noblemen) into <em>Gloucestershire</em>, where I saw the Sins
of the People were as red as the Scarlet they die;
so I soon shook the Dust off my Shoes, as a Testimony
against their Wickedness, and went to <em>Oxon</em>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>No sooner was I enter’d into <em>Oxfordshire</em>, but
I was in as longing a Condition, as the big-bellied
Woman was for a bite of a Butcher’s Arm, to see
the most famous University of <em>Oxford</em>; thinking
that in that Academy and Nursery of Learning,
I should see Piety, and Virtue, climb up to the
very Apex of Glory; but too soon were my
Hopes frustrated, for instead of Religion and good
Manners, I beheld nothing but Irreligion and
Prophaneness; for the Scholars were so far from
being religious, that they were asham’d of nothing
so much as that any should have the Charity
to think them so. They seem’d to cry out
upon <em>Eve</em>, for a lazy and dull Sinner; whilst in
every Oath they loudly swore, that Soul not worth
damning, that could not sin without a Temptation.
By their horrible and hideous Oaths they
shew’d, as if indeed they had this desperate Design
upon Almighty God, to render his sacred
Name odious to the World, by taking it often in
their profane Mouths. Their chief Delight was
to dwell upon the sore Place of an obscene Poem;
at the same Time never commending the Poet,
but for his Infirmities. Those Sparks call’d Gentlemen
Commoners, were so fantastical and prodigal,
that they walk’d as if they went in a Frame;
next as if both Head and every Member of
them turn’d upon Hinges. Every Step they
took, presented me with a perfect Puppet-Play;
and <em>Rome</em> itself could not in an Age have shew’d
more Anticks, than one of these Blades was able
to imitate in half an Hour. Here those who
have Money enough allow’d them by their Friends,
learn first of all to make Choice of their boon
Companions, how to rail at the Statutes, and
break all good Orders; how to wear a gaudy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
Suit, and a torn Gown; to curse their Tutors
by the Name of <em>Baal</em>’s Priests, and to sell more
Books in half an Hour, than they had bought
them in a Year; to forget the second Year what,
perhaps for want of Acquaintance with the Vices
of the Place, they were forc’d for a Pass-Time
to learn in the first, and then they think they
have Learning enough for them and their Heirs
for ever.</p>

<p>Thought I to my self, if this is <em>Oxford</em>, the
Devil take the Collegians and Citizens too, for
there was never Barrel the better Herring betwixt
either of ’em; one was full as bad as the other,
so I e’en made the best of my Way into <em>Buckinghamshire</em>,
where, at <em>Eaton</em> College, finding the
Scholars to have more Guts than Brains, and less
Learning and good Manners than either of the
two, <em>Utrum horum mavis accipe</em>, as you may see
in <em>Syntaxis</em>. I rambl’d through <em>Oxfordshire</em>, again
into <em>Worcestershire</em>, where I observ’d nothing material,
but poor Skeletons of Men and Women,
knitting Mittins and Stockings; and Children,
both Boys and Girls, smoaking Tobacco, in Pipes
as black as their Faces, and about an Inch in
Length, for a Breakfast. Hence I went into
<em>Herefordshire</em>, where I thought myself under the
same Punishment, as <em>Tantalus</em> was when in Hell, for
the Hedge-Rows all along the Roads, being full
of Apple-Trees, the Apples would bob at my
Mouth, but I could not catch ’em, which I think
was tantalizing me with a Vengeance.</p>

<p>I had not been long in this County, before I
steer’d my Course for <em>Warwickshire</em>, where in the
City of <em>Coventry</em>, I was shew’d the wooden Picture
of a Cobler, which (as the People told me) was
made to perpetuate the Memory of one of <em>Crispin</em>’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
Occupation, whose Mouth watering to peep thro’
his Garret Window, to see the Lady <em>Godiva</em>’s <em>Ay-forsooth</em>,
as she rid naked on Horseback through
the City, to release the Inhabitants from heavy
Taxes laid upon them by her Husband <em>Leofric</em>,
he was struck blind for his Sauciness of presuming
to look at lac’d Mutton. But above all, this
County glories much in that it gave Birth to
<em>Guy</em> Earl of <em>Warwick</em>, who killing a fierce dun Cow
upon <em>Dunmoor-Heath</em>, by <em>Dunchurch</em>, both which
Places (I suppose) take their Names from this
heroick Bravery; and for this Piece of Service
and other Exploits, as killing a wild Boar; his
Memory is also still perpetuated, as well as the
abovesaid Cobler’s, in many Victuallers Signs, to
this Day.</p>

<p>Next, going into <em>Northamptonshire</em>, and Night
beginning to creep upon me, I began to be mighty
Melancholly, as being all alone; but as good
Luck would have it, I overtook a Cordwainer,
who (as he told me) was newly recover’d from a
sad Mischance; for walking carelesly one Day, he
happen’d to have a Fall, and to squat his Breech
upon a Hedge-Hog, which he carry’d away as
cleverly (it clinging to his Buttocks) as if he had
sate upon a Ball of his Wax. Whether there is
a Sympathy between a Shoemaker’s Tail, and
the Skin of an Urchin, or whether the Bristles
of the Creature enter’d the Pores of his Backside,
I list not to decide that Controversy now; but however,
the Mortal complain’d, that it was an uneasy
Cushion, and that that Spinny of Awls, had made
a Cullender of his Backside. But being not much
concern’d at the Cerebrosity of his scievy Bum, the
Eyelet-Holes whereof being not very deep, we
went together, till we came to a Church, standing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
like an Ace, and moping by itself, at some
Distance from a little Village; which, whether
it ran from the Parish, or the Parish from it, I
was not then inform’d; though I have most Reason
to suspect the latter, in Regard as to outward
Appearance the weak Constitution of the Fabrick
seem’d not much to be addicted to run. It
seem’d to be very crazy, and had a Muffler of
Ivy, which I presume was instead of Crutches;
for whereas that feeble Vegetable is usually upheld
by the Walls it clings to, I believe it was a
Buttress here to support the Walls. But having
sadden’d our Aspect with the melancholly Looks of
this desolate Temple, we took our leave of it, and
shot directly into the Village; at our first Salutation
whereof we chanc’d to pop into a dapper Ale-House,
mightily stuft with a huge Hostess, whose
Moisture distilling through the Pores of her Body,
and being somewhat turn’d through excessive
Heat, struck our olfactive Nerves with so great
a Sowerness, that we had quite been overcome
with this Vessel of Vinegar, had she not too
much jogg’d herself by an unhappy Fall, and spilt
a great Quantity of her unctuous Liquor. The
Shoemaker conjectur’d she had lost about five
or six Pounds Avoirdupois, from her Rear, and
presently concluded she was in great Danger
of hanging all a-one-Side, unless some charitable
Person should help her with Thrust of assisting
Nose. We had scarce prim’d our Pipes, but in
comes a Law-Jobber, accompanied with a Bum-Brusher,
or School-Master of the Place, who, after
some Time, took Occasion to try their Skill and
Breeding at Fistycuffs, but (Thanks to the Stars)
without any Danger to their Professions; for they
did not so much Aim at the Head, as level their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
Fury at each others Heels, where their Knowledge
was not suppos’d to lie, tho’ some there held
that they had as much Learning at one End, as
they had at t’other.</p>

<p>At this blind Alehouse, I and <em>Crispin</em>’s Disciple
lay one Night, whence, we sojourn’d together
into <em>Bedfordshire</em>, till we came to <em>Dunstable</em>,
a Town builded by King <em>Henry</em> I. to bridle the
Outrageousness of one <em>Dun</em>, a notable Thief, from
whom it takes its Name. Here, Mr. Snob having
a Mistress, and being almost within the
Atmosphere of her Presence, began to wind her,
and had a great Tendency to the Place were she
was; so that I might as soon expect a Stone
to fall beyond the Centre, as that this Gentle-Craftsman
should budge further; wherefore, nothing
was expected now, but an immediate Divorce
from each others Company; but before we
parted, he oblig’d me with the Prospect both of
her Person and Fortune. As for the first, as soon
as I saw it, I had greater Reason to congratulate
my Eye-sight than before; for she was blest with
the most ravishing Aspect, and a snug Face, most
prodigiously grac’d with a dainty fine Nose, fasten’d
in the Middle; which was not like some
Snouts that look more upon one Cheek, than
they do upon the other, but shew’d equal Prospect
to both, not at all disobliging the Right, by
fleering too much on the Left. And then for her
Eyes, they are excellent at twiring, and would
(I warrant you) be sure to keep the Nose safe,
for one look’d one Way, and the other, another.
The Woman had a Mouth too, which was somewhat
bigger than that of a Blunderbuss, tho’ not
twice as big as the capacious Bore of a <em>Winchester</em>
Quart-pot. This Mouth, she put but to one Use,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
and that’s the same we put ours to, that is, to
eat three or four Meals in a Day; for it seems,
whereas other Women often use theirs in Prating
and Twatling, we perceiv’d, that this
sav’d her Mouth, and spake through the Nose.
As I have given you the Picture of her Person,
so now I’ll present you with a Landskip of her
Fortune. As for her Lands, that is, Pasture-Ground,
and Meadow, we could not discern,
but that (like a Spot upon the Globe) they
took but little Room upon the Surface of the
Earth; and (like the Possessions of <em>Alcibiades</em>)
were but a little Speck to the World. A little
Muck would dung her Fallow; one high Table
T⸺ (to speak in the <em>Oxford</em> Dialect) would
much enrich it, and an Ear of Corn would go
near to sow it: ’Tis like, she had Grass enough
for a Couple of Rabbits. Having surveyed the
Paramour, and the Portion of this snivelling
Cobler, after a Treble go-down out of a Tin-Pot,
a right Line Scrape with Left-Leg, and uncouth
Doffing off a bad Bonnet, I return’d his Coblership
Thanks for his Society, and solemnly took
Leave of my Fellow-Traveller.</p>

<p>After this Departure, I was forc’d to beguile
away the Time in the shady Solitude of silent
Thoughts, which, before, I spent in the brisker
Entertainments of Discourse and Dialogue. At
length I came into <em>Cambridgeshire</em>, some Parts
whereof seem’d to be a little <em>Arabia</em> of Sand, enough
(as I thought) to supply all the Hour-Glasses
in the County; nay, perhaps, and that
of Time too, till the last Minute. Arriving at
the University of <em>Cambridge</em>, I lay at <em>Jesus</em> College,
in the Garden of which Place, I discover’d among
some Ruins, the Snout, and some other Limbs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
of a murder’d Dial; yet it was not so defac’d,
but that I could discover in its Physiognomy, some
martyr’d Figures, that were yet legible, and there
were some Reliques of Lines, that were not quite
obliterated by Time, who, I presume, being vext
that it should observe his Motions, had out of Envy
and Malice, thus far set his Grinders in it, to
deface it. Here, the Students, at <em>Oxford</em>, would
be as drunk as any Woman, outswear a Life-guard-Man,
or Horse-Grenadier; and eat, drink,
and lie with any Body. But when I saw whole
Shoals of great hulking Fellows, in such ragged
Gowns, that our <em>London</em> Bunters would scorn to
pick ’em up, flocking about the Kitchen-door,
some with Basons, some with Porringers, some
with Pipkins, some with Pans, some with Chamber-Pots,
and some with their very Caps, to
beg College Broth; I thought the Scene a very
lively Resemblance of poor Lazarus, begging for
the Crumbs which fell from the Table of <em>Dives</em>.</p>

<p>Hence, I went into <em>Huntingdonshire</em>, which is a
very proper County for unsuccessful Lovers to
live in; for upon the Loss of their Sweethearts,
they will here find an Abundance of Willow-Trees,
so that they may either wear the Willow green,
or hang themselves, which they please; but the
latter is reckon’d the best Remedy for slighted
Love. Passing through <em>Godmanchester</em>, I rambled
to <em>Watford</em> in <em>Hartfordshire</em>, near which Town, formerly
stood <em>Langley-Abbey</em>, the Birth Place of
<em>Nicholas Breakspear</em>, who in the Year 1154, being
advanc’d to the Papal Dignity, assum’d the Name
of <em>Adrian</em> IV. and tho’ he had been a poor Servant,
was so proud, as to excommunicate an Emperor
of <em>Germany</em>, a <em>Sicilian</em> King, and the Senators
of <em>Rome</em>; for these Popes are sawcy Fellows,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
when they come to wear triple Crowns, as Kings
of Heaven, Earth, and Hell; which last Place,
they have enjoy’d by Hereditary Right and Succession,
many Ages before the Reign of Pope
<em>Joan</em>.</p>

<p>Going next into <em>Essex</em>, which is as subject to
Agues, as the Hundreds of <em>Drury</em> is to the Pox,
and the whole County much noted for its excellent
Calves, but the biggest of that Sort of Cattle
are the Inhabitants. I pass’d through <em>Colchester</em>,
and crossing the County, got into <em>Staffordshire</em>,
where being inform’d at the City of <em>Lichfield</em>,
that the Thief-taker-General of <em>England</em> first
receiv’d his damn’d stinking Breath in that County;
I did not care for staying long there, for
Fear, the Change of this Air should make me as
vile, and double corrupted a ⸺ as himself.
In case it should be this Fellow’s good Fortune to
dance at <em>Tyburn</em>, betwixt Heaven and Earth, as
being unworthy of either, the Ordinary of <em>Newgate</em>
may give this Account of him in his dying
Speech; how that his Parentage was very obscure
and mean; his Livelihood at first was obtaining
Charity from Milk-Maids, and other
Country Lasses, by squeezing pretty Ditties out of
the Womb of a Bladder, with a Piece of Packthread;
and if he should prove so harden’d at the
Gallows, as to make no larger Confession of himself,
set him down (like <em>Paul Lorrain</em>) obstinate. In
fine, he had such a bad Character among his own
Country-Men, that some said, it was great Pity
he had not been hang’d as soon as he was breech’d;
whilst others reply’d, that he ought never to die,
but be toss’d from D⸺l to D⸺l, till there
was no Hell left to toss him in any longer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>I soon made the best of my Way into <em>Shropshire</em>,
where, at a little Town, or rather Village,
call’d <em>Woor</em>, happen’d a sad Misfortune; for a certain
Glass-Case, by Reason of the Rudeness of
two lusty Pusses, but whether affrighted at their
Catterwauling, or it being not able to bear them
in the Acts of Love, I cannot tell which, but
certain it was, it let go its Hold, and after a dismal
Manner, came blundering down, attended with
the Ruin of several Jiggumbobs, and Jimcracks, as
the Ivory Gums of a toothless Comb, a little
bottle-breech’d Glass replenish’d with Love Powder;
a Brace of blind Needles, that lost their Eyes
in the Fall; a double Scut of a Hare ty’d up with
a single Packthread; the latter End of an old
Broomstick; the Butt End of an old Sugar-Loaf;
the true Lovers Knot made in Wire, a square bit
of Tin, the Margin of a broad Hat, one Finger-Stall,
two Taggs, a Fescue made of Brass Wire, a
crack’d Glass with a Club-Foot, the Skin of an
Onion stuft with Arsenick, and one Whisker of a
bearded Arrow. But as one Misfortune seldom
comes alone, so this was attended with another,
for a young <em>Salopian</em> Lass who was the Proprietor
of these Things, took the Accident of them so
much to Heart, that she very decently hang’d
herself, to the no small Comfort, to be sure, of her
Parents, who had six or seven Children, besides
this unhappy Daughter, whom nobody could
blame for this Piece of Rashness; for is it not a sad
Thing to lose so commodious a Place, to lay pretty
Things in, and all by the Misdemeanour of two
unmannerly Cats? For where could this poor
Creature afterwards have laid her Gally-Pots,
Gums, and Pomatum? Had these Mousehunters
only eas’d Nature there, and then jingerly departed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
they had been very excusable, but first to
come slily into a Ladies Chamber, and then to
squabble and fall out there, and in the Midst of
their Quarrel to pursue one another to the Top of
a Shelf, and there to renew the Battle again, and
to box one another ’till they fell themselves, and
demolish’d that very Thing which supported them
in their bickering, as the Fool in the Fable saw’d
off the Bough he sat on, Oh! this is a very sad
Thing indeed, and would make any other young
Woman, who had no more Sense then she, hang
herself likewise.</p>

<p>But bidding Adieu to the proud <em>Salopians</em>, I
went into <em>Cheshire</em>, where the Towns ending much
upon the <em>Wich</em>, as <em>Nantwich</em>, <em>Middlewich</em>, <em>Northwich</em>;
I thought they affected the <em>Dutch</em> Way of
putting one Name to the End of their Towns, as
<em>Rotterdam</em>, <em>Schiedam</em>, <em>Amsterdam</em>, and so forth.</p>

<p>In the City of <em>Chester</em>, I happened to lie at a
Physician’s House, whose Pretences to Learning
were very great, but by our Conversation, I
found him to have more Stomach than Brains,
and therefore was more like to have more Consolation
in the Kitchin, than in a Study; for there,
perhaps he might find a Jobb of Work for his
Grinders; whereas he knew not what to do with
his Books, unless he should act the Moth, and eat
them. I perceiv’d his Parts to lie more towards
the Powderingtub, than his <em>Pharmacopeia</em>; for
whilst he was busy in the former, he might keep
himself alive, but when he read in the latter,
he would kill his Patients. We had some roast
Beef for Supper; and I commonly found him
within an Inch of the Dripping-pan, with an Acre
of Bread in his Hand, which he call’d a Sop,
and with it, when my Back was turn’d, he usually
spung’d up the Dripping, whereby he cheated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
Sir-Loyn, and robb’d his Knighthood of its
due Moisture. Hence, I went into the County of
<em>Northumberland</em>, where I found <em>Newcastle</em>, almost
entirely surrounded with Coal Pits, whence seeing
Myriads of Men, as black as <em>Old Nick</em>, ascending
out of the subterranean Shops, upon the Surface
of the Earth, I imagin’d them to have been so
many <em>Cyclops</em> who had been helping <em>Vulcan</em> to forge
Thunderbolts for <em>Jupiter</em>. Not liking the Conversation
of these <em>English</em> Negroes, I stept over the
River <em>Tine</em> into the County of <em>Durham</em>, where,
in the City bearing the same Name, I lay one
Night; and next Morning taking my Leave of
my Landlady, about half a Mile from the Town,
I saw a Church-Yard, where was a whole Herd
of Swine a routing, as if they had been turn’d
in on Purpose to root up <em>Christians</em>, as they are in
the Fields in <em>Italy</em>, to dig up Turfles. A little
Wall lay sculking about this Territory of the
dead, which I suppose, was plac’d there as a Bulwark
to their Ashes; but it prov’d but a feeble
Fence against the Intrusion of the Lambs, who
made frequent Capreols into this silent Dormitory:
The Mound was rais’d a little, capt with
Turf, and environ’d with the Hollowness of a
good handsome Ditch; but yet, neither Cap, nor
Ditch could keep these Animals from leap-frogging
over them, from grazing in a Charnel-House,
and from turning a Cœmitery of Shades,
and Ghosts into a feeding Pasture of hungry
Beasts.</p>

<p>At last, I got into <em>Yorkshire</em>, where, beyond
<em>Northallerton</em>, meeting with a Herdsman, I was
almost frighted out of my Wits, for this Fellow
was a strange Creature, wonderfully <em>Goth’d</em>, and
be-<em>Vandall’d</em>, even to Barbarity itself. He was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
really a Clown in grain, an uncultivated Boor,
a Beast of the Herd in Humane Shape. I propos’d
a Query or two about the Genius of the
County; he told me the Soil was cold, and big
with Clay, and would doubtless yield a good
Harvest of Tobacco-Pipes; and as for the Inhabitants,
he said, they were a Pap-Pudding Sort of
People, much addicted to that vile Sort of Creature.
As he said, I saw a whole Table at a
Christening, spread with a Yard of Pudding,
and a Balk of Beef, a Ridge at one End and a
Furrow at the other; which did so wonderfully
work upon the Chaps of the Gossips, and make
their Mouths water, that the Godfathers and
Godmothers fell furiously to Snouting for some
few Morsels; mean while the two ear’d Pitcher,
that stood upon the Bench, was Mr. <em>Prynn’d</em> in
Scuffle, that is, lost a Lug in the Fray; and as I
was afterwards inform’d, the Distaff lost a Lock
or two of its flaxen Perriwig. The Women of
this Country are very coming, and are as great
Breeders, as any of our <em>English Quakers</em>; and as
for the Men, they are naturally born Thieves,
being as dextrous Rogues at Horse-Stealing as a
Serjeant at the <em>Poultry</em>, or <em>Woodstreet-Compter</em> in
selling Minutes dearer than a Watchmaker. But
among rational Wonders in a Village, where
I say, the most remarkable <em class="smcap gesperrt">Wonder</em> was
an eminent Cot-Quean, a meer Woman in the
Habit of a Man, a Kind of <em>Mol Cut-Purse</em>
Creature, an Epicene Animal of a twisted Gender,
who had a Petticoat Soul in a trunk-breech’d
Body, and scandaliz’d Virility, by Skill in Housewifery.
He spun (the Neighbours said) like a
Spider, and made his Wheel giddy by a swift
<em>Vertigo</em>. He was a learned Craftsman in the making<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
of Diet, a notable Food-Framer, who buffeted
Cream, till he frighted it into a Consistence,
and then knocking it into Butter, squeez’d it
afterwards with Dexterity of Fist. He was also
endow’d with the Gift of tossing Pancakes, and
had a wonderful Knack at tempering the Materials
of a Bag-Pudding, insomuch, that he surpass’d all
the Dairy-Maids in the Milk-Pan Accomplishments;
and was also excellently well qualify’d
for a Meal-Tub Office. Here I tasted of the
Hospitality of this fœmasculine Wight, who
spread a Jointstool with several Sorts of Viands,
which though not very delicate, yet the Variety
might attone and make amends for their
Meanness. Here was the <em>Epidermis</em> of a Hog,
the outward Skin, call’d the Sword of Bacon,
which was infected with the Jaundies, for it
look’d very yellow; next, was the Hull of a
Pescod, plunder’d of its Pease, and corn’d with
Salt; some broken Fragments of Sheeps Trotters,
<em>St. Laurenc’d</em> on a Gridiron; the minc’d Spurs
of a bootless Cock, a skin’d Quadrant of soft
Cheese, well sawc’d with the Butt-ends of forked
Scallions; and the mouldy Reversion of an antiquated
Loaf, dipt in the Verdure Watercresses
Pottage, which afforded me the Refreshment of
a pretty Collation: After which I went to Bed,
and slept very sound till next Morning. When,
getting that Day, into <em>Newark</em> upon <em>Trent</em>, <em>Nottinghamshire</em>,
I was no sooner arriv’d into the Navel
of the Town, but I saw such an Assembly of
Provision as represented a Market, which was
unhappily disturb’d by an unfortunate Accident;
for a certain Bull of an uncertain Man, having
mistaken his Box, and taken Pepper in the Nose
instead of Snuff, and being enrag’d and heated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
by Virtue of the Spice, took a frisk about the
Cross, and empty’d by his Ramble all Stalls and
Panniers; so that this brisk Customer made a
scrambling kind of Dinner for the whole County;
for the Mob, <em>alias</em> the civiliz’d Rabble, was riding
upon one anothers Backs for Viands and Booty,
and was tumbling among the Ruins of Bakers,
Butchers, and Costermongers.</p>

<p>Hence I made a Pilgrimage to <em>Grantham</em> in
<em>Lincolnshire</em>, where a little out of Town I over took
a Fellow, who began to strike up with his Pipe,
and thinking he had but one, he presently perceiv’d
it to be multiply’d into an Organ, and
wonder’d (with the Bumpkin that pull’d at the
Bellows) that he had so much Harmony in him.
For you must know hereabouts dwelt a Thing
call’d an <em>Eccho</em>, who as soon as she heard <em>Sol</em>, <em>fa</em>,
whip! she improv’d the Melody into Noise and
Consort; presently increasing those single Notes
into the whole <em>Gamut</em>; and most neatly play’d
the Wag with the Tail of his Voice, being a very
pretty Songster, that sings well by the Ear. But
leaving the Piper by himself to solace with the
tatling Reverberation of Voice, I proceeded on
my Journey into <em>Rutlandshire</em>, the least County in
<em>England</em>, where at <em>Oakham</em>, the Shire-Town, is a
Custom, that when a Nobleman comes on Horseback
within its Precincts, the Inhabitants make
him pay the Homage of a Shoe from his Horse,
or take Money for it. And so exorbitant is this
Custom grown now, that if a Lady, be she as tall
as long <em>Meg</em> of <em>Westminster</em>, or as short as the little
Woman, that was carried formerly about the
Country in a Box, as fat as the Royal Sovereign
the largest first Rate Fire-Ship that sails <em>Drury-Lane</em>,
and the narrow Seas contiguous to it, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
as lank as <em>Pharaoh</em>’s lean Kine, they would swear
she was a <em>Flander</em>’s Mare, and presently take toll
from her Foot. This Sharpness hath made most
of the <em>Rutlandshire</em> People, much addicted to the
Vice of Theft; every Thing sticks to their pitchy
Fingers; and they have such an attractive Virtue,
that wherever they come, all Things trot after
the Magnetism of their Persons. A Fellow squating
upon a Criket in a Room I was in, and rising
up from his Seat, the Stool on a Sudden (as
if tackt to his Backside) immediately march’d
after him, to the great Amazement of the Woman
of the House, who did not suspect, that his
Bum had Hands, or that her Stool so nimbly
could have us’d its Legs. Another espying a
Cylinder of Bag-Pudding pretty Thick in the
Waste, lolling upon the Table, whilst the Hostess
turn’d her Back, in the very twinkling of her
Head, pocuss’d it into Fob, and so shrouded its
Dimensions into a second Bag. Moreover observing
a joulter headed Fellow, looking very wishfully
at my Head, fearing he had some Design upon
what few Brains I had, to furnish his own
empty Noddle; I presently paid my Reckoning,
and made the best of my Way for <em>London</em>; where
I was no sooner arriv’d, but perceiving most People
murmuring at the great Indulgence then extended
to the <em>Dissenters</em>, I composed (at the earnest
Request of some Friends) the following Lines
on Toleration.</p>

<p class="dropcap">Having had a Suit of Law in
Chancery, which was lost thro’ my
Lawyers Mismanagement, at the
Charge of twenty five Pounds out
of Pocket, I could not forbear making
the following Observations on
the Unhappiness of those People who go to Law.</p>

<p>Some are so zealous to ruin one another, that
<em>Westminster-Hall</em> is every Term made the Place of
Destruction. They fasten upon, worry and tear
one another; and he that gets the better, generally
pays so dear for his Victory that he had
better have sat down by the Loss. Not that I
would, with the <em>Socinians</em>, stretch that Command<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
of our Saviour to his Disciples, to let the Coat go
after the Cloak, and make it a Sin against the Gospel,
for Christians to go to Law, any farther, than
that they should not contend for Trifles. <em>Christianity</em>
lays no Body open to be abus’d, and impos’d
upon, where a regular Remedy may be had. It
forbids doing as we would not be done by, and
obliges us to bearing and forbearing, rather than
to be litigious; but takes away no Body’s Property,
nor gives so much Countenance to Injustice,
as to disarm the oppress’d from recovering their
Right. Had going to Law been a Crime in itself,
it had never been permitted to the <em>Jews</em>.
They were allow’d it, and had Courts by divine
Appointment erected for the Determination, of
what belong’d to every Man. And it is too much for
a few singular Dissenters upon a Text, to take upon
themselves the putting a Bar to <em>Christian</em> Liberty,
which in all Ages has been admitted. Nor can
we see here that these Precepts of the Sermon upon
the Mount, be confin’d as some would have them,
to the first Ages only: That what was legal in
those Days, it is not the same now. It seems to
be from too much Inclination to the World, such
Expositions have been set up, that make a Difference
in Times and Seasons, as if the Precepts
of the Gospel were not always of the same Obligation;
and we could excuse ourselves in the
Contempt of them, because we are not the Persons
they were immediately deliver’d to.</p>

<p>Tho’ the litigious Humour of some Men richly
deserve a chargeable Remedy, there is yet a
Commiseration due sometimes to their Antagonist.
A Man may, whether he will or not, be engag’d
in these bloody Conflicts at the Suit of his Neighbour’s
Pride or Malice. And since the most peaceable
Temper may be oblig’d to complain of Oppression,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
or answer the Charge of Picque and Revenge;
’tis Pity but Justice were to be obtain’d
at a cheaper Rate, and a slight Wound may be
cur’d without Amputation, which nothing but a
Gangrene can justify. We could wish the Law
were less chargeable; that seeking Right were
not as bad as suffering Wrong: That the Avenues
to Justice were not to be set with Robbers, that a
Man must lose one Purse to recover another, and
be stript into the Bargain. <em>Justice</em> (we are told)
should be blind, and so we think she is, when she
can’t see the exorbitant Fees of her Attendants.
When to be let in and let out, costs so much Oppression,
nothing could have been severer. When
the Man that’s summon’d to answer in a litigious
Suit, must go thro’ so many Toils, and be so often
spung’d in his Passage, he might as well have
pass’d for Guilty, as pleaded Innocence: Like
the Christians in <em>Turkey</em>, who pay double Taxes
for their Religion, and hire infidel Moderation
to connive at their Patriarch’s Jurisdiction. Why
these Imposts were laid upon the Road to Justice,
we never could understand. How that can be
made out, we are much at a Loss. Which of the
liberal Arts or Sciences thrives upon the Fees of
Door-Keepers? Is copying and Abbreviation so
essential a Point to Learning, a Nation could
not have maintain’d a Character without it? Are
so many Lines a Sheet, and so many Words in a
Line, so Mathematical a Substraction of ones
Money, that the Credit of the Nation must rise
in Proportion to the Losses of the poor Meagre,
wasted <em>Culprit</em>? We are told too ’tis upon a politick
Account, to prevent Contention: That the
more difficult is the Way to Justice, the more
People are inclin’d to be quiet. If the Courts
were open to every Grievance, there would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
Complaints without End. A Hog could not go
thro’ a Stone Yard, but the Law must be rais’d
against the Trespasser. A Man could not be an Hour
without a <em>Subpœna</em> or Attachment, if there was
Room for every Body’s Impertinence. ’Twould
prevent Contention as effectually, if the Person
in Fault were punish’d; if paying sufficient Cost
to the Adversary or Fine, were inflicted by the
Court upon a litigious Plaintiff, or roguish Defendant.</p>

<p>As the Cause stands, the Law is a Weapon for
the Proud, and revengeful. These may be in
the Right, at least have their Revenge, if their
Purse be the longest. So chargeable have been
the Methods of bringing Oppressors to Account,
so expensive the Armour to defend the Innocent,
that one may think the first Loss had been the
best, and the other wish he had let the Coat go
to him that had taken away the Cloak. There’s
a Revolution indeed of Estates, and where the
Law has broke one Family, it has rais’d another.
If the Desolation the Law has made, were recorded,
and the Ensigns of the Orphans and Widows
were hung up, whose forlorn Relations have
been press’d into the Service, there would be no
Room for those brought from the <em>Danube</em> and
<em>Ramellies</em>. ’Tis true, much may be said in Favour of
a mistaken Client, in Excuse of Ignorance, Passion,
and the like: But where a Man engages in a
Cause palpably litigious and unjust, he becomes
a Party to the Injustice, and deserves at least
equal Punishment with him he appears for. <em>Thou
sawest a Thief, and consentedst unto him</em>, is chargeable
upon the Pleader, as a Person concern’d.
Should these Maintainers of Learning be mercenary,
and like Sergeants at the <em>Compter</em>, gape at
every Retainer? Should they have an Indulgence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
to cross-bite an Evidence, to abuse the Adversary,
and rip up the Misfortunes of his Family,
and belch a few Witticisms instead of Arguments?
How shall the World maintain Reverence
to their Opinion? How shall we take them
for the Guides of Conscience, set aside the receiv’d
Interpretation of the Law, and believe them
when they say, <em>The Case is alter’d</em>? I shall say
no more upon this Point, but only use these
Words of our Saviour, <em>Woe unto you also, ye Lawyers:
For ye lade Men with Burdens grievous to be
born, and ye yourselves touch not the Burdens with one
of your Fingers. Wo unto you Lawyers: For ye have
taken away the Key of Knowledge: Ye enter’d not in
yourselves, and they that were entring in, ye hindred.</em></p>

<p>Being quite surfeited with seeing the Legerdemain,
or <em>hocus pocus</em> Tricks of Madam <em>Astræa</em>, <em>alias</em> Justice,
the Day after <em>Trinity-Term</em> being, drest with <em>Aurora</em>,
nay before she had put on her <em>Indian</em> Gown, I set
out with the Sun in order to take a Pilgrimage into
<em>Wales</em>, who bearing me Company but little
while, withdrew into an Appartment behind a
Cloud, at whose Absence, the Heavens frowning
and contracting their Brows, did presently fall
a crying, and wept such plentiful Showers of
Tears that they moistned my Skin with the
Deluge of their Grief. At the End of 8 or 9
Days, I reach’d <em>Wales</em>, which is the most monstrous
Limb in the whole Body of Geography;
for ’tis generally reported to be without a Middle,
or if it hath a Navel, it is yet a <em>Terra incognita</em>;
for I never could find that ever any
Man dwelt there, the Natives confessing themselves
only Borderers. Surely the Reason why
they do so much affect the Circumference of their
Country, and abominate the Centre, is, because
they are asham’d of the Dominion; and indeed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
’tis a Sign they have but a little Kindness for
their Nation, who (like unnatural Sons) run from
their Mother their Country, and when out of her
Embraces, never return again. A <em>Welshman</em>,
when once abroad, hath no more Tendency Home,
than a Stone an Inclination to fall upward:
He will trot o’er the Globe, and rather endure
the Affliction of any Exile, than the cruel Punishment
of being banish’d Home; if he is once on
this Side <em>Dee</em>, neither Hunger, nor Husks, nor
any Kind of Hardship shall drive him on the
other.</p>

<p>No sooner had I set my Feet upon <em>Welsh</em> Turf,
but in a little Time I found the Country was
tuckt in on all Sides with the Sea, except on
the East, on which Part it was ditch’d in from
<em>England</em> by that notable Delver, King <em>Offa</em>, King
of the <em>Mercians</em>: Over this Dike, if any <em>Welshman</em>
chance to skip with his Sword by his Side, by
King <em>Harold</em>’s Law, he was to lose a Branch of
his Body, <em>i. e.</em> his right Arm was lopt off by the
King’s Officers. Some think it had its Name
from its Godfather <em>Idwallo</em>, Son to <em>Cadwallader</em>,
who with a small Crew of <em>Britons</em>, at the Arrival
of the <em>Saxons</em>, hid themselves in this Corner.
Others suppose them to be the Spawn of the
<em>Gauls</em>, from whom they seem to be but a few <em>Aps</em>
remov’d; <em>ap Galloys</em>, <em>ap Gauls</em>, <em>ap Wallois</em>, <em>ap Wales</em>.</p>

<p>As for the Inhabitants, they are a pretty Sort
of Creatures, which when I saw, I was so far
from stroaking them with the Palms of Love,
that I was almost ready to buffet them with the
Fist of Indignation. They are a rude People,
and want much Instruction. Not one <em>Welshman</em>
is sharp, unless his Mother happens to pour Vinegar
into his Ear, when young. When I consider
the Soil from whence they sprang, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
Desarts, and Mountains wherein they wander,
I cannot but think, that greater Pains should be
taken in cultivating and manuring, in disciplining,
and taming them, in Regard ’tis harder for
a Bearward to teach Civility to the Beasts of
<em>Africk</em>, than those who come from a more mannerly
Country. I have been inform’d that they
were dug from a Quarry, and that they dwell
in a stony Land; so that if we compare this
Kingdom to a Man, as some do <em>Italy</em> to a Man’s
Leg, they inhabit the very Testicles of the Nation.
And I pray what are those but the vilest of Creatures
that breed as well in the Privities of the
greater <em>British</em> World, as those that are hatcht
in the <em>Pudenda</em> of the lesser? But whether <em>Welshmen</em>
are the <em>Aborigines</em> of their Country, as Crab-Lice
are the <em>Autocthones</em> of theirs, and proceed
only (like them) from the Excrements of their
Soil, I shall not here dispute. They are of a
boorish Behaviour, of a savage Physiognomy;
the Shabbiness of their Bodies, and the Baoticalness
of their Souls, and that, which cannot any
otherwise be exprest, the <em>Welchness</em> of both, will
fright a Man as fast from them, as the Odness
of their Persons invites one to behold them. Some
of them are such rude and indigested Lumps, so
far from being Men, that they can scarce be
advanc’d into living Creatures; nay they are such
unmanageable Materials, that they can scarce be
hewn into the Shape of Blocks; much Labour
and Art is requir’d therefore to make them Statues.</p>

<p>The whole Nation (like a <em>German</em> Family) is
of one Quality; for as every Lord’s Son is a Lord
in <em>Germany</em>, so every one is crown’d with the
Title of Gentleman here; so that hur Country
is a good Pasture for an Herald to bite in. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
their Travels they care not much that their
Horses should drink with a Toast, as appears by
the which a <em>Shinkin</em> discover’d, whom his quaffing
Beast had pitch-pol’d into a River. Udsplutter-a-nails
quoth he in great Fury, what cannot
hur drink without a Toast? He took it much in
dudgeon, that the Jade should be so bold as to
make a Sop of his Master.</p>

<p>The Materials of his Apparel are usually a
well shagg’d Freeze, so that we cannot call it
sleepy, being fleec’d with a Nap like any Sheep-Skin:
It affords excellent Harbour to the Vermin
of his Body, which whether it be stockt
with Store of Joicements of them, he commonly
signifies by the Symbol of a Shrug. The Perfection
of a <em>Welshman</em>’s Equipage, the Cream (as
it were) of his Accoutrements, and that which
compleats ever his most festival Attire, is (as the
Story goes) an old Sword of hur nown breeding,
which hur hath brought up from a Tagger: And
this he can brandish with much Valour against
the tremenduous on-set of dragooning Bees; a
kind of Enemy which the Taffy is much afraid
of, in Regard he is always arm’d with a Pike in’s
Reer, which once upon a Time fastening in his
Forehead, broach’d such a Pore in his Physiognomy,
that he could never endure those hum-buzzing
Gentlemen (as he calls them) in yellow
Doublets.</p>

<p>The Country is mountainous, and yields pretty
Handsome clambering for Goats, and hath Variety
of Precipice to break ones Neck; which a
Man may sooner do than fill his Belly, the
Soil being barren, and an excellent Place to
breed a Famine in. It is reported of <em>Campania</em>,
that it was the most noble Region in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
World, the Air pleasant, the Soil fertil, the
Theatre of <em>Bacchus</em> and <em>Ceres</em>, where they were at
fisty-cuffs for the Preheminence: But I perceiv’d
no such Scuffle in <em>Wales</em>; for those Deities are so
far from fighting there, that I could not discern
they were so much as ever there; there being
scarce Water and Oatmeal to give a Man Being.
I could not expect <em>Egypt</em> and the <em>Canaries</em> Buts
and Granaries to give me a well Being: There
is no <em>Canaan</em> to be found in a Desart. As for
the Diet of a <em>Briton</em>, a good Mess of Flummery,
and a Pair of Eggs, he rejoyces at, as a Feast,
especially if he may close his Stomach with
toasted Cheese, for a Morsel of which he hath
a great Kindness. You may see him pictur’d sometimes
with that Crevice in his Head call’d a
Mouth, charg’d at both Corners with a Cresent
of Cheese, and himself a Cock-Horse on a red
Herring, and his Hat adorn’d with a Plume of
Leeks: Good edible Equipage! Which when
hunger pinches, he makes bold to nibble; he
first eats his Cheese and his Leeks together, and
for second Course he devours his Horse. But
he never much cared for a Sop, since once upon
a Time it drank up all his Drink, and would
not club to pay his Shot.</p>

<p>The <em>Cambro-Britons</em> are great Admirers of heroick
Actions, and much Honour the Memory
of famous Atchievements; insomuch, that rather
than a dead-doing Man shall perish in Oblivion,
they will eternize his Memory by the
Monument of a Straw, or some such inconsiderable
Trifle; as appears by the famous Example
of that Saint of their Country, Bishop <em>David</em>, who
being a pert Fighter, and having soundly basted
and swadled their Foes, is at this Day consecrated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
to Posterity by the Trophy of a Leek; and
smells as rank of Renown from that vegetable
Preservative that embalms his Fame, as they
do of a Scallion that carry it about for his Glory.
Their Hats are set with this anniversary Badge,
and Emblem of Honour and Triumph, on the first
of <em>March</em>, which Day hath been christen’d by
his Name, and being dubb’d an Holyday, hath
worn yearly a black Livery in the Almanack.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the <em>Welchmen</em> being cursedly thick-scull’d,
they are so far from being Plotters, that
they swear they will never fight for any King
upon Earth, but the Prince of <em>Wales</em>; because
there can be no true Royal Blood running in
the Veins of any great Man, but what borrows
his Title from their Country, let him be born
where he will: And considering what wicked
plotting Times we now live in, no Body can
blame them for their Cautiousness of being hang’d;
for tho’ it is a Death natural to them, yet they
say, sleeping in a whole Skin is best. Not that
they value hanging, but only they abhor the
Death, unless the Office is perform’d a by a <em>Welch</em>
Hangman, instead of an <em>English</em> one.</p>

<p>They are much inclin’d to Choler, for hur
<em>Welch</em> Plood is soon mov’d, and then hur stamp
and stare, and scrat hur Pole, and vent hur Fury in
Ud-splutter-a-nails, and will fight for hur Life in
Battle at fisty-cuffs. They are polite in nothing
but Faction and Sedition, for there are high and
low Church Parties among them too, which occasions
much Contention and Quarrels.</p>

<p>The Musick a <em>Welchman</em> plays upon, is a Tool
stiled an Harp, with which, when Sustenance
fails him, he strikes up for a Morsel, and so lives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
by Sounds, and (Camelion like) hath Alimony
from Air. He serenades Victuals in every Village,
as the pide Piper did Rats at <em>Hamel</em>, and
he allures Luncheons after him, as much as the
other did Vermin: Here a Nob of Bacon wags
after him, for one Strain; and there a Crust follows
him, as the Reward of another; one hits him
in the Mouth with the Payment of Pottage, another
pops him in the Pocket with the Gratuity
of a Carrot; all which Variety of Fragments
is the most ample Income, and wonderful Revenue
of his Skill in Musick. His usual Admirers
are Country Milk-Maids, whom Vibration of
String doth move and stir into Jigg and Measure;
and whom Breeze of Instrument (like those in
Tail) do chase and tickle into Dance and Caper.</p>

<p>I could not perceive that the <em>Welch</em> were guilty
of much Learning, which made a Man skill’d in
Orthography admir’d as a Sophy; and a Writer
of his Name, to be term’d a Rabbi. As for the
Loves of the <em>Britons</em>, the Intrigues of their Amours
are not a little remarkable, they being very pretty
Animals when disguis’d with that Passion:
They are Tinder to such Flames, being quickly
set on fire, even by the least Spark, which when
it hath catch’d the Match of their Souls (for they
have Brimstone in them as well as in their Bodies)
they are presently kindled into Transport and
Extasy; and these model them into the Shapes
of a thousand Anticks, and make them shew more
Tricks than old <em>Preston</em>’s Bears. Sometimes they
are shaking the Globules of their Noddles, and
sometimes dancing some Geometry with the Figures
of their Feet; now they smite with Clapper
of Fist their troubled Breasts, and anon
sound out some Knels of dismal Groans; being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
variously affected as the Weather is in their <em>Clorinda</em>’s
Faces; if Aspect be clear, then is <em>Taffy</em>
serene; if brow be cloudy, then is <em>Morgan</em> Showry.
Whilst I was in this Country, I heard of a <em>Welchman</em>
that went a wooing with a Gun upon his
Shoulder, being resolv’d (it seems) if Love be
a Warfare, not to enter unarm’d into the Camp
of <em>Venus</em>; still as his coy <em>Daphne</em> shifted from his
Presence, he march’d musketeering about the Room,
and most fiercely pursu’d her, till at last in the
brisk Encounter of a close Embrace, this warlike
Instrument took an Occasion somewhat unmannerly
to go off, and blunderbuss’d the Mistress on
her Breech on one Side of the House, and poor
<em>Taffy</em> on his Nose on the other; so that being
much dismay’d at this unhappy Accident, one
scrabled one Way, and the other another, to the
utter spilling of a Mess of Love, and total Separation
of a Pair of Lovers for ever.</p>

<p>They are pretty devout in their Worship, tho’
the Exercise of Religion is somewhat scarce, and
have a pretty glowing Zeal, tho’ their Churches
are few, and at a great Distance. ’Tis almost
incredible how far they are fain to trudge for a
little Homily; which when they have expected,
have been mump’d with a Sermon ten Times
worse. For on such raw-bone Livings, there cannot
be expected very plump Parts. The ordinary
Revenue of a spiritual Preferment may possibly
be about five Marks <em>per Annum</em>; a Bay of Watling
for a Dwelling, endow’d with no more Glebe
than just what it stands upon, only perhaps it
may be how-stall’d with as much Ground as may
hold a Sty for the Pig, and a Roost for the Pullen.
These divine Cottages are usually situated
some Leagues from the Temple, so that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
Holy Man with Crab-Tree Truncheon sets out
with the Sun, and stretches his Legs with a good
handsome Walk, before he arrives at the Pulpit to
stretch his Lungs, and wears out much of his Soles
before he can reach his Stall to mend their Souls,
Their Houses of Prayer are generally thatcht Tabernacles,
which are wainscoted towards the East
with little Desks, like Pounds, where <em>Levite</em> imprison’d
for about half an Hour, fodders the poor
<em>Taffies</em> with some <em>melancholy</em> Tear-fetching Story
about a grim Fellow call’d Death, who ambles
Folks on his Back into another World; a Thing
which he heard from the oracular Gums of his
edentulous old Granum, as she sate on the Settle
in the Chimney-Corner. Some of the most reverend
Rectors are dignify’d with a Stipend of six
Pounds a Year, besides the Perquisities of a Drum
and Fiddle; which well manag’d on a Holiday,
make up a very pretty Thing. Others have an
Augmentation of a Bull or a Bear, which being
solemnly baited about twice in a Quarter, do
pick pretty comfortable Tyth from the Spectators
Pockets, and makes the poor Parson’s Purse
to smile and mantle.</p>

<p>As far as I could perceive, the <em>Welch</em> People
love Holiday Fingers, and care not much for
encumbring them with that Inconvenience call’d
Work. They can (Shepherd like) loll upon a
Crook pretty handsomely in the Field, and can
discharge a Superintendency over the Goats. They
are most accomplish’d Drovers, to which laudable
Function they are so naturally prone, that
they are apt to drive sometimes more than their
own. They are much addicted to the Sin of Nastiness,
wallowing in Filthiness like so many Swine;
so that the whole Nation seems but a general<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
Sty. The meaner Sort of Women are generally
such draggle Tails, that the Cattle in their Bosoms
are quag-mir’d in the Filth of their well-gleb’d
Attire; so that the frisking Fleas are so far
from <em>Levalto</em>’s, that I was verily persuaded they
can scarce pull out <em>Proboscis</em>, and their Feet from
the Bogs. The Tenements they live in are suitable
to the Guests that possess them; for as these
seem to be Dirt moulded into Men, so those are
the same Matter kneaded into Houses; they are
usually very humble Cottages, and low in Stature,
so that a Man may ride upon the Ridge, and yet
have his Legs hang in the Diet. I was not so
vain as to expect very splendid Furniture in such
contemptible Huts; but I soon perceiv’d what
Utensils were most necessary, a Dish-Clout and
a Besom, and such cleansing Implements are very
proper to correct the Filthiness of their Mansions.
I found no Apartments in these their Habitations,
every Edifice being a <em>Noah</em>’s Ark, where a promiscuous
Family, a miscellaneous Heap of all
Kind of Creatures did converse together in one
Room; the Pigs and the Pullen, and other Brutes
either truckling under, or lying at the Bed’s-Feet
of the little more refin’d, yet their Brother Animals.</p>

<p>But that which I admir’d most of all amongst
them, was the Virginity of their Language, not
deflowerd by the Mixture of any other Dialect.
The Purity of the <em>Latin</em> was debauch’d by the
<em>Vandals</em>, and hunn’d into Corruption by that
barbarous People; but the Sincerity of the <em>British</em>
Tongue remains inviolable. ’Tis a Tongue (it
seems) not made for every Mouth, as appears by
an <em>English</em> Gentleman one Day in my Company,
who having got a <em>Welsh</em> Polysyllable into his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
Throat, was almost choak’d with Consonants,
had I not, by clapping him on the Back, made
him disgorge a Guttural or two, and so sav’d
him. Whether the <em>Welsh</em> Tongue be a Splinter of
that universal one that was shatter’d at <em>Babel</em>, I
have some Reason to doubt, in Regard ’tis unlike
the Dialects that were crumbled there. However,
’tis now cashir’d out of Gentlemen’s Houses, there
being scarcely to be heard even one single <em>Welsh</em>
Tone in many Families; for their Children are
instructed in the <em>Anglican</em> Idiom, and their Schools
are pædagogu’d with Professors of the same; so
that (if the Stars prove lucky) there may be
some glimmering Hopes that the <em>British</em> Tongue
may be quite extinct, and may be <em>English’d</em> out of
<em>Wales</em>, as <em>Latin</em> was barbarously <em>Goth’d</em> out of
<em>Italy</em>.</p>

<p>But in fine, being quite out of Conceit with
the short Commons I met with in this Mountainous
Country, which was much inferiour to the
delicious Dainties of Water-Gruel, Bread and
Butter, and Small Beer, allow’d to the poor Lunaticks
of <em>Bedlam</em>, after they come to pig in
Straw, and have their Heads shav’d as an Introduction
to Phlebotomy, three or four Times a
Week, I e’en bade adieu to the miserable <em>Taffies</em>,
and made the best of my Way to <em>England</em> again,
to recover that Flesh in a plentiful Nation,
which I had lost in a Land of meer Poverty
and Famine.</p>

<p class="dropcap">Being returned out of <em>Wales</em> into
<em>England</em> again, I was no sooner
got into <em>London</em>, but thro’ an avaricious
Temper, I soon began
to haunt most of the Gaming-Houses
in Town, which Day and
Night were as well cram’d as the Groom-Porter’s
Table. In these Schools of inevitable Ruin
and Destruction, I lost a great deal of Money,
and when too late to recover it, I began seriously
to reflect with myself, that let a Man be ever
such a good Gamester at Cards or Dice, yet so
many Sharpers were always flocking about him,
that they would drain his Pockets in spite of all
the greatest Favours of Fortune; or else how
could these Gaming-Houses clear sometimes
100 Pounds, but never less than 50 or 60 Pounds
a Night, besides paying Salaries to the several
Officers depending solely on them? For there
<em>Commissioners</em> are maintain’d by whom the Weeks
Accompt is Audited, <em>viz.</em> <em>Directors</em>, who Superintend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
the Room. <em>Operators</em>, or Dealers at Faro.
<em>Croupees</em>, to watch the Cards, and gather the
Money for the Bank. <em>Puffs</em>, who have Money
given them to play, in order to decoy others.
<em>Clerks</em>, who are Checks upon the Puffs, to see
that they sink none of that Money. <em>Squibs</em>, who
are Puffs of a lower Rank, having half their Salery;
<em>Flashes</em>, who sit by to Swear how often
they have stript the Bank; <em>Dunners</em>, or Waiters;
<em>Attornies</em>, or Sollicitors; <em>Captains</em>, who
are to Fight any Men that are Peevish, or out
of Humour at the loss of their Money; <em>Porters</em>,
who at most of the Gaming-Houses are Soldiers;
<em>Ushers</em>, who take care that the Porters
at the Door suffer none to come in but those
they know; and <em>Runners</em>, to get Intelligence of
all the Meetings of the Justices of the Peace,
and when the Constables go upon the Search:
Besides giving half a Guinea to any Link-Boy,
Coach-man, Chairman, Drawer, or other Person,
who gives Notice of the Constables being
upon the Search.</p>

<p>Now to break myself from this bewitched
Gaming, I bid adieu to Hazard, Backgammon,
Tick-tack, l’Ombre, Picquet, Cribbidge, and
Basset, and was resolved to take a Pilgrimage into
<em>Scotland</em>, where I found the Inhabitants addicted
to no sort of Game but <em>One and Thirty</em>,
at which they are as dextrous as a Milk-Maid
at Dancing on <em>May-Day</em>, with one Foot upon
the Ground, and t’other never off; for from
<em>Fergus</em> their first King down to <em>Charles</em> the First,
whom they Sold for a Sacrifice to Stratocracy
or Army Power, they had Murder’d no less than
Thirty One of their Sovereigns, which is just
the Game at Regicide: Hereupon to call them
Traytors is a Favour, for they will hatch Treason<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
as soon as they do <em>Chickens</em> at <em>Grand-Cairo</em>, by
the Adoption of an Oven; but now the <em>Scots</em> are
bound to their good Behaviour, by a Union,
they ought to be as Circumspect in their Loyalty,
as the Ambassador that Beds a Queen, with
the nice Caution of a Sword between them.</p>

<p>It is said that <em>Scota</em> the Daughter of <em>Pharaoh</em>
King of <em>Egypt</em>, who was Drown’d in the <em>Red-Sea</em>,
gave Name to <em>Scotland</em>, when she went thither,
and betwixt which People and the valiant
<em>English</em>, a Quarrel continued longer than ever
did any between any other two Nations in the
World, for they have most obstinately contended
(like <em>Rome</em> and <em>Carthage</em>) for Empire above
2000 Years; which is the most tenacious Suit
that ever depended between any two People in
the Court of <em>Mars</em>. Since the <em>Norman</em> Invasion,
there have been 30 pitcht Battles betwixt
us and them; of which the <em>English</em> have obtain’d
of the <em>Scots</em> at least four for one, and those of
greatest Consequence. The South Part of <em>Great-Britain</em>
being Champian, hath been sometimes in
its Borders harrass’d, and laid wast by the <em>Scots</em>,
never possess’d, but their Country, defended by
inaccessible Hills, and by two invincible Enemies,
Hunger and Cold, hath been wholly reduc’d by
the <em>English</em>, who have Slain four <em>Scotch</em> Kings,
and took two Prisoners; whereas they have never
Slain nor took Prisoner one <em>English</em> King, to
whom the Kings of <em>Scotland</em> were Homagers for
a long Time.</p>

<p>Those <em>Scots</em>, who dwell by the Sea, dung their
Land with the Weeds which it casts on the
Shore; and all Women throughout the Country
in Writing use their Maiden Names after
Marriage. About the High and Solitary Hills
of <em>Genap</em> I saw good Store of Magpyes and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
Goats; but few Hogs, to whose Flesh they bear
as utter an Aversion as the <em>Jews</em>; and among
all their Flocks of Sheep, where you’ll see one
White, there’s ten Black, so that you may soon
know a <em>Scotchman</em> from a black Sheep. The farther
I Travell’d, I observ’d Geese were not over
plentiful; Parsnips very scarce; Venison not
to be had for want of Deer; Boys Knitted, and
Men, Women, and Children went bare-legg’d.</p>

<p>As for their Coyn, the most remarkable of
their Coyning is a <em>Baubee</em>, which is the value of
our Half-penny, bearing the royal Effigy on one
side, and on the Reverse the Thistle and Crown,
with this Motto, <em>Nemo me impune lacessit</em>. In
the Kirk-Yard at <em>Girvan</em> are several Carv’d
Grave-stones; and at the Kirk-Door in this
Town are fasten’d Jogs or Brad-Irons to Chains
three or four Feet long; which are put round
Persons Necks, who Swear, get Drunk, or break
the Sabbath. Thus by countenancing Religion
in allowing their Pastors to have an Authority
over Misdemeanors, it is that the tumultuary
<em>Scottish</em> Institution has gain’d Ground, and insinuated
itself into popular Credit and Esteem:
For on every <em>Sunday</em>, when the Office of the
Day is over, they have a Kirk-Sessions, wherein
the Minister, with a Number of his Congregation
Elected to that end, is Authoriz’d to
meet and take Cognizance, and to punish all
Offenders the foregoing Week. So some such
Authority, and a few more insulting Priviledges,
seem to be some of those <em>Desiderata</em>’s aim’d at
by our pretended Reformers of Manners in <em>England</em>,
to make up their Temporal Advantages,
under a specious show of designing to restore
the more Primitive and <em>Christian</em> Discipline.
But I hope this Age will never experience what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
it is to come under the Pharisaical Constitution
of such pious Cheats. Nevertheless, since
Knowledge without Virtue has abus’d the
World with too much Impiety, I applaud that
one Thing of the reforming Societies in <em>England</em>,
in putting poor Children out to Trades; for
of what Use is Learning (any farther than
Reading and Writing) to ordinary Vocations?
Whatsoever exceeds, is Useless, and makes
them Pragmatical: Moreover, as it is not their
Happiness to obtain Advantages of a more liberal
or academical Education, it will much
more commend the Goodness of their small
Breeding, that they have learnt to speak Truth
rather than <em>Latin</em>, which the Masters of our
Parish Schools understand not; and that they
are more knowing and exact in the Rules of
Justice (a transcendent Quality unknown to
some of their Benefactors) than the Distinction
of Languages.</p>

<p>In my Journey not far from the Town of
<em>Ayre</em>, many Sales are to be taken on the Sea-Coasts;
but on the Land not many Pidgeons,
nor great Store of wild Ducks: However, the
Country is well stockt with other sort of Foul,
as foul Plates, foul Dishes, foul Trenchers, foul
Knives, foul Forks, foul Napkins, and by Heavens
foul ever thing else, even to their very
Women, who you’ll see standing on a <em>Saturday</em>
by a lolling Wash-block, which is a Wooden
kind of Anvil, where the She-<em>Vulcans</em> are hammering
out with Battledore, or else with their
Feet in a washing <em>Tub</em>, the Filth of Linnen,
whose unctious Distillations are the <em>Nile</em> that
water’d the little <em>Egypt</em> of their adjacent Gardens.
Staring very earnestly with all the
Eyes that I had, as if looking thro’ a Perspective<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
Glass, I perceiv’d every <em>Scotchman</em>’s Face
usually bubbled into Bubbles and Pustulees, besides
the natural Hout-goust of Body that
breath’d from Oatmeal, which made him send
forth an Artificial Smell, which you might
wind as far as the extream Unction of 20 <em>Romish</em>
Funerals, only the Scent is not so Sweet;
besides the bonny <em>Scot</em> smells as rankly of the
single Stink of Brimstone, as a Goldfinder, <em>alias</em>,
Tom-Turd-Man of a Medley; for a scurvey
Disease, commonly call’d the Scrubbado, otherwise
the Itch, makes frequently an Inroad into
his Person, and invades his Body; so that he is
forced to choak his Enemy by Stink of Sulphur.
’Tis a Creeping Distemper, whose Progress is
checkt by Mortification, so that when he leaves
off his Shirt, that is, when it leaves him, and
can hang on no longer, it is excellent Furniture
for a Tinder-Box, as virtually containing in it
both Match and Tinder.</p>

<p>The common People wear Plads and Bonnets,
which is a great Fashion in this Country, where
the Postman goes a Foot; and poor Folks eat
the Stalks of raw Kale. The Elders of the
Kirks on <em>Saturday</em> night duly haunt the Ale-houses,
which they call Changes, to turn out
People to prepare themselves for the <em>Sabbath</em>;
and Women here ride astride, without any Danger.
The Kirks or Places of Worship have all
one Bell, rung by an Iron Chain; but put at
either End of the House of Prayer, without any
Distinction of East or West, so that Travellers
must not look upon their diminutive Steeples
for the Guide of a true Course to the Compass.</p>

<p>At the University of <em>Glascow</em>, which like their
other poor Universities has but one College, I
saw no other Learning but the insipid Collegians<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
wearing red hanging-sleev’d Gowns; and
the Cathedral here was built by one Mr. <em>Mongou</em>,
I can’t call him Saint, because he was the
Son of a Whore begot by a <em>Danish</em> Prince on a
<em>Scotch</em> King’s Daughter. Because our main or
chief Gallows in <em>England</em>, call’d <em>Tyburn</em>, hath three
Beams, and which is famous for stocking the
<em>Romish</em> Calendar for roguish Saints, the <em>Scotch</em> to
exceed us will have four Beams on their hanging
Places, made in the manner of a <em>Turn-Stile</em>;
having on each Beam an Iron Hook, on which
the Malefactor is to be expos’d in a pendent Posture
betwixt Heaven and Earth, as being unworthy
of either. The Men for the most part
wear Stockings made of Plad-Stuff; and their
Quarters are <em>Candlemas-Day</em>, <em>May-Day</em>, <em>Lammas-Day</em>,
and <em>All-hallow Tide</em>, which are as welcome
to their Landlords as our Quarter-Days are among
us.</p>

<p>Bad Cooks are every where in this Nation,
because they have seldom any Victuals to dress;
and the Childrens Cradles here made of old
Wainscot without Heads to them. The <em>Scots</em>
have several old Ways to distinguish themselves
from <em>Christians</em>, for their Chimes always ring
before the Clock strikes; instead of Candles
they burn in most Places the Shavings of Fir
dipt in Tallow; their Spoons are generally
made of Horn quite circular or round, about
3 Inches Diameter, with the Length of the Handle
suitable to its Circumference, which Largeness
(I suppose) they take from the old Proverb,
<em>He must have a long Spoon that eats with the Devil</em>;
and those People that can but fill their Bellies
with thin Bannock, Sourings, or Bruis, which
last sort of Food is only raw Oatmeal put into
Water when it’s warm, and thought by them a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
great deal better than to dine with Duke <em>Humphrey</em>.
Hemp and Flax for Linnen are the Staple
Commodities of this Nation; but the <em>Scots</em> bear
a mortal Hatred to the former, because by the
Production thereof, a great many of ’em come
to an untimely End.</p>

<p>When I came into the City of <em>Edinburgh</em>,
which is the Capital of the Kingdom, I thought I
was got into <em>West-Smithfield</em>, for such a Place
for Nastiness was not to be found upon Earth,
for as the latter was but fill’d with Beasts Dung,
the other was more nasty than a common Jakes
or Inns-of-Court House of Office, for having a
Dung-Tub at the Head of every Pair of Stairs
in their Houses, which are 14 or 15 low Stories
high, they are emptied a-nights on Peoples
Heads without any respect of Persons, so that
till 8 or 9 o’ th’ Clock in the Morning, the
whole City, which may be a Mile in Length, is
scented with the excellent Perfume of <em>Scotch</em>
Civit Cats; and all the Woman here look as ugly
as the <em>Four of Clubs</em>, which some call <em>Wibling</em>’s
Witch, from one <em>James Wibling</em>, who in the
Reign of King <em>James</em> the First grew rich by private
Gaming, and was commonly observ’d to
have this Card in his Hand, so that he never lost
a Game but when he mist it.</p>

<p>All the <em>Scots</em> are generally as great Enemies to
Gentility and nice Dressing, as <em>Diogenes</em> the morose
<em>Cynic</em> was to <em>Plato</em>, because of his courtly
Compliance with the World; and to be honest
would be as great a Mortification to them as
<em>Lent</em> to a poor Player. They’ll sit as lovingly
about Oaten Cakes and Butter, as a Parcel of
Tarpaulins round a Platter of Burgue; and
they love Hunger and Ease, as well as a Lawyer
does <em>Term-Time</em>. Tho’ they hate the solemn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
Festival of <em>Christmas</em>, and other Holy-days, yet
they pay some Veneration to St. <em>Andrew</em>; and
will be as Drunk on the <em>30th</em> of <em>November</em>, as any
Shoemaker once a Year to the Remembrance
of <em>Crispin</em>. They hold Fairs in many Places, at
which is much Mobbing, Whoring and Drunkenness
as at our <em>Shirking-Fair</em> by <em>Tyburn</em>: And
Mrs. <em>Cicilia</em>, they say, is no Saint, but a common
Strumpet bred up at a Three-penny Hop
in <em>London</em>. I never saw the Sign of the <em>Brats-Tumbler</em>
any where, which makes me believe
every <em>Scotch</em> Woman brings her Urchins into
the World, without the Assistance of Madam
<em>Grope</em>, to save Charges; on a <em>Sunday</em> Morning
the <em>Scots</em> will run 4 or 5 Miles to a Conventicle;
and in the Afternoon to the Mountains
to louse themselves.</p>

<p>It is suppos’d by some, that <em>Scotland</em> is the
Land of <em>Nod</em>, to which <em>Cain</em> was exil’d a Vagabond
for the Murther of his Brother <em>Abel</em>; and
truly in my Opinion the Supposition may be
Very probable, for <em>Cain</em>’s being an Inhabitant
there, the Ground hath been curst ever
since, for it is a most barren Place to this very
Day. Had grazing <em>Nebuchadnezzar</em> been here,
he would have found but bad Pasture; and <em>Judas</em>
as much plagu’d for a Tree to hang himself
on. Bag-Pipes they esteem before Organs;
there’s as much Hypocrisy in their Pantile-Houses
as Irreligion in a <em>Jews</em> Synagogue; and
the Dog-Days are not so warm here as in more
Southerly Climates, but their Bitches Nights
every where are too hot with a Vengeance.
Here is every Day an Autumn among the Women;
for, for a Noggin of Brandy they will
fall as thick on their Backs as the Leaves in St.
<em>James</em>’s Park do in <em>September</em>; and Law and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
Equity are as great Strangers to the <em>Scots</em>, as Honesty
to the Justice of Peace that’s lately run
from <em>Clare-Court</em> to the <em>Mint</em>, and who (when
in Commission) was fitter to sit on a Butcher’s
Block, as his Father did before him, than in a
Magistrate’s Chair.</p>

<p>The Castle at <em>Edinburgh</em> is reckon’d as impregnable
as a <em>Scotchman</em>’s sear’d Conscience;
and their Capital contains but one Broad Street,
by which is an University containing one College
of Scholars poor both in Purse and Head.
Here are no Carts, but sliding Cars; and the
highest Number I ever saw on their Hackney
Coaches exceeded not 29. The <em>Scots</em> reckon
their Children spurious if they have not the
Itch; and there’s as much Whoring every Day,
as at <em>Bartholomew</em> or <em>Southwark</em> Fair. They
Bury the Dead at Noon, to save the Charge of
Torches; and as here are no Linkmen, only
Boys and Girls light Passengers with Candles in
Paper Lanthorns all about Town for a Baubee.
Most of the People are generally of the Religion
with them who marry without a Ring,
Christen without the Cross, and Die without
Baptism. Their Pastors, who are of the true
Stamp of <em>Geneva</em>, endeavour by long extemporary
Prayers and tedious Graces, to save the poor
Souls of those Mountaineers; but yet their Hypocrisie
Damns more than ever <em>Sampson</em> Slew,
and with the same Weapon too, <em>the Jaw Bone of
an Ass</em>. The <em>Presbyterian</em> Government is uppermost
here; which Religion being a good quiet
Subject, I could not forbear setting forth the
Piety of a <em>Scotch Presbyterian</em>, in the following
Lines.</p>

<p>A <em>Scotchman</em>’s Tongue runs high Fullams, there
is a Cheat in his Idiom; for the Sense ebbs from
the bold Expression, like the Citizen’s Gallon in
<em>London</em>, which the Drawer interprets but half a
Pint. As they never speak as they think, their
false Tongues may be compar’d to the Cards at
<em>Primiviste</em>, in which Game 6 is 18, and 7 is 21.
The poorer sort have a piece of Linnen peeping
out at their Collars for show of a Shirt; but
with long wearing it is so black and ragged,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
that it is going to the Paper-Mill as fast as it
can. When the Beasts enter’d into the Ark by
<em>Pairs</em>, I wonder how <em>Noah</em> coupl’d the <em>Scots</em>, for
they are strange Creatures both by Sea and
Land; and an Ass is scarce to be had in this
Nation either for Love or Money, because they
put ’em all into Commissions of the Peace. They
retain one barbarous Custom still, and that is,
if any two be displeas’d they expect no Law,
but bang it out, one and his kindred against the
other and his; being so implacable in their hatred,
that on each side they use a Scale of Destruction,
by striving to ruin the Father, beggar
the Son, and strangle the Hopes of all Posterity:
And this Fighting they call their <em>Feider</em>,
a Word so barbarous, that was it to be express’d
in <em>Latin</em>, it must be by Circumlocution.</p>

<p>Their ill Manners make them look more salvage
than the Monsters put by <em>Astrologers</em> to
the Humane Limbs in <em>Anatomy</em>; wherefore it is
strange that <em>Physicians</em> do not apply a <em>Scotchman</em>
to the Soles of the Feet in a desperate Fever,
for he would draw far beyond Pidgeons; and it
is thought some of our <em>English</em> Quacks, Empericks
or Mountebanks will slice one to try the
Experiment. The <em>Scots</em> were ever as great
Friends to the King of <em>France</em>, as <em>Don Quixot</em>
was to <em>Sancho Pancho</em>, who fought at all Adventures
to purchase the other the Government
of an Island which was none of his; and they
think themselves as brave Fellows as the <em>Spanish</em>
Knight Errant, when he fought a Windmill, to
the great Danger of breaking the Necks of him
and his Horse <em>Rosinante</em>, when it flung ’em both
into a Pond. Their Godliness is of the same
Parentage with good Laws, both extracted out
of bad Manners; and their Teachers live upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
the Sins of their Congregations, which verifies
the Axiom, <em>Iisdem nutritur ex quibus componitur</em>.
They dread to be civiliz’d; and they
have a great Antipathy against Church Windows
which are painted, when a Looking Glass
would shew them more Superstition: In fine, a
<em>Scotchman</em> is such a Hater of Images, that he
hath defac’d God’s in his own Countenance.</p>

<p class="dropcap">Having seen too much Villany
in <em>Scotland</em> to pay the least
Adoration to the Country, I return’d
to <em>London</em> again, and after
a short Stay there went for
<em>Highlake</em> in <em>Cheshire</em>, where going
on Board the <em>Seaforth</em> Gally, Sail was presently
hoisted, and in a few Hours bidding Adieu to
the Sight of Old <em>England</em> and <em>Wales</em>, we came
to Anchor in the Bay of <em>Dublin</em> very early on a
<em>Whitsun-Monday</em> in the Morning. Here I went
ashore at <em>Dunlary</em>, and being got safe in that
Part of <em>Terræ firmæ</em>, which, I think, is situated
<em>in podice Mundi</em>, I went Five Miles farther to
<em class="gesperrt"><i>DUBLIN</i></em>, the Metropolis of <em>Ireland</em>, standing
on the <em>Liffie</em> River, as well as the Sea. This
Country is seperated from <em>England</em> by a very
dangerous Sea, in which meeting with a most
dreadful Hurricane, as soon as the tempestuous
Weather was over, my <em>Muse</em> incited me to delineate
the Seamens Devotion in bad Weather,
in the following Meditation.</p>

<p>But being got upon firm Land again, as I said
before, I was very glad of visiting the <em>Irish</em>
Natives, tho’ they are not yet wholly brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
to a civil Course of Life, thro’ the Fathers inflicting
an heavy Curse on all their Posterity, if
ever they should sow Corn, build Houses, or
learn the <em>English</em> Tongue: And the Reason of
this inveterate Antipathy is, because heretofore
there being but one Freeholder in a whole
County, which was the Lord himself, the rest
held in Villanage; and being subject to the
Lord’s immeasurable Taxations, they had no
Encouragement to build, sow, or plant. <em>Ireland</em>
is divided into 4 Provinces; namely, <em>Munster</em>;
<em>Leinster</em>, where <em>Stonehenge</em> once stood, but
by <em>Magick</em> Art <em>Merlin</em> remov’d those ponderous
Stones out of this Territory into <em>Wiltshire</em>;
<em>Connaught</em>, where are some Vines, but rather
serving for Shade than Profit, for in these
Parts the Sun entring into <em>Virgo</em>, causeth cold
Gales to blow, and in Autumn the Afternoon’s
Heat is so faint and short, that it cannot ripen
the Clusters; and <em>Ulster</em>, whose antient Custom
in making their King was by taking a white
Cow, which his <em>Irish</em> Majesty must kill, and
seeth the same in Water whole, then must he
bath himself therein stark naked; and sitting
in the Caldron wherein it is sod, accompanied
with the People round about him, he and they
eat the Flesh, and drink the Broth (much Good
may’t do ’em) without Cup, Dish or Spoon.
No sooner was I arriv’d at <em>Dublin</em>, but being in
Company with some Collegians of <em>Trinity-College</em>
there, which is all the Colleges their University
contains, they to shew their extraordinary Parts
to me a Stranger in a poetick Way, made Verses

<p>This Satyr being Truth and Matter of Fact,
how well it pleas’d the <em>Irish</em> Collegians may be
easily guess’d, however taking leave of my learned
Company, I went out to look about me in
the City, where I star’d and gap’d around,
like our Country Hicks upon the Signs in <em>London</em>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
the Monument, or Tombs in <em>Westminster-Abby</em>.
<em>Ringsend</em> Coaches, so call’d from a Place
of that Name about a Mile or two out of the
<em>Dublinian</em> Suburbs, I saw were more numerous
than Hackney or Gentlemen’s Coaches; and
which being a sort of Carts made with a Seat
before, wherein People may be jolted 3 or 4
Miles for 2 Pence, your topping City Cuckolds
and their Wives very often ride out of Town
in ’em, to make a Demolition of Cakes and
Ale. Being mounted next upon <em>Lousie-Hill</em>, and
asking whence the Place deriv’d its Name, some
knowing People inform’d me, that an old Woman
once dwelling there, to whom honest St.
<em>Patrick</em>, a Swineherd, and tutelary Patron of
that Kingdom promis’d to clear that Nation of
Lice, she fell a weeping, and humbly besought
the good old Man not to destroy them, because
the Inhabitants had no other Diversion on <em>Sundays</em>,
than to sit at home and louse themselves;
whereupon her Request being granted, the <em>Irish</em>
enjoy the Company of their native Cattle to
this Day, in Memory of which peculiar Favour
this Street ever since bears the Name of <em>Lousie-Hill</em>.
At last I rambled into <em>Smock-Alley</em>, where
the <em>Irish</em> Theatre is situated; Curiosity led me
soon into it, when <em>Dryden</em>’s Opera, call’d King
<em>Arthur</em>, was to be acted, which is a Play I lik’d
well enough, excepting these two Lines in Act
I. Scene I.</p>

<p class="noindent">For tho’ the <em>Greek</em> and <em>Latin</em> Poets, in their
Compositions, made their <em>Hexameter</em> or <em>Heroick</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
Verse, compos’d of <em>Dactyls</em> and <em>Spondees</em>, yet
always observing to have each Line to end with
an <em>Adonick</em> likewise, it runs smoother than
what our Language will with 15 or more Syllables,
for we cannot exceed 10 Feet, or 12 at
the most, without offending a delicate Ear.</p>

<p>Farther, let me observe, that the <em>Irish</em> Stage
is now as much cumber’d as the <em>English</em> Stage,
with Inventions not used in former Ages; I
mean with <em>Opera</em>’s and <em>Farce</em>; the first stupifying
the Audience in such a quivering Manner in
their Songs, that the Words and Sense too are
both lost in the Tune: And the other is a Representation
of Things not natural, and is but
one, or 3 Acts at most; contrary to the Rule
of dramatick Poetry, which, <em>Horace</em> says in his
Book <em>de Arte Poetica</em>, must have no more or less
than 5 Acts. As for <em>Comedy</em>, it is as much, nay
more corrupted in <em>Ireland</em>, than in <em>England</em>,
<em>France</em> or <em>Italy</em>, in too much admitting the <em>Mimick</em>
in the <em>Drama</em>: And let me tell you (tho’
a Pilgrim) that since I am enter’d upon this
Discourse, I must take Notice, that tho’ <em>Comedy</em>
is an Imitation of inferior People in Ridicule,
yet ought not the Ridicule to be extravagant,
but gracefully and slightly touch’d, as
by <em>Terence</em> in his Pieces. Again, altho <em>Comedy</em>
represents low Persons, yet are they not the
meanest, since it brings eminent Citizens and
Magistrates on the Stage; nay, <em>Plautus</em> in his
<em>Amphytrio</em> introduces Gods and Kings, but nevertheless
it is a true <em>Comedy</em>, because he hath
turn’d the Subject of <em>Tragedy</em> into Ridicule;
and it looks beautiful enough, if the Actors
have a Regard to their Pronunciation and Gesture,
according to <em>Quintilian</em>’s Rule, in the
11th Chapter of his First Book which is this:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
<em>Debet etiam docere comœdus quomodo narrandum</em>,
&amp;c. That is, a <em>Comedian</em> ought to teach how
we should speak, with what Authority we
should persuade, with what Emotion Anger
should be rais’d, and with what Change of Voice
we may excite Pity: I can’t blame those who
spend some Time with the Masters of the palestrick
Art; that is, those who form the Gestures
and Motions, teach how to hold the
Arms, and the Hands, that we seem not to be
rustick, or ignorant, to have no unseemly Carriage,
no unbecoming Posture of the Feet, and
that the Head and Eyes don’t differ from the
other Motions of the Body. But these Rules
are no where strictly observ’d by Players:
Moreover, as the Design of <em>Comedy</em> is to rectify
the Manners of Men and Women, nothing
ought to be represented which may vitiate the
Audience, for the People being generally the
same, they obstinately retain the most licentious
and obscene Things; especially when they
are impiously joyn’d to Religion. Indeed <em>Ben
Johnson</em> is often guilty of this Fault in his <em>Volpone</em>,
especially where he brings in Sir <em>Politick
Would be</em> talking thus prophanely to <em>Peregrine</em>.</p>

<p class="noindent">Also <em>Ben Johnson</em> in his <em>Alchymist</em> so much dishonours
his Maker, as to suffer the most tremendous
Name of God to be made so vile and
cheap, as to be us’d often as an expletive Particle
to prevent a Chasme, or make up a Gap in
a Sentence, that it may run more smoothly; as
appears by some of his Persons thus speaking.</p>

<p>As for <em>Tragedies</em>, those are the most perfect
ones in which there are <em>Peripeties</em>, that is, Revolutions,
Changes of Fortune, and Remembrances,
as in the <em>Oedipus</em> of <em>Sophocles</em>, the first
<em>Tragedy</em> of all Antiquity, where in the 3d Scene
of the 4th Act, the <em>Peripetie</em>, or Change of one
Fortune into another, is contrary to what was
expected, in the Man that comes from <em>Corinth</em> to
acquaint <em>Oedipus</em> of the Death of King <em>Polybius</em>.
I shall not take Notice of the Duration of the
Representation of a <em>Play</em>, which ought not to
exceed the Space of a natural Day; but observe,
that the Sect of the <em>Peripateticks</em> believing
neither <em>Providence</em> nor <em>fatal Necessity</em>, but
imputes all Accidents to Chance, the antient
tragick <em>Poets</em> chose rather to follow the Opinion
of the <em>Stoicks</em>, who acknowledge a <em>Providence</em>
and fatal Necessity; as very well perceiving,
that that was the only Means to preserve
the <em>Theatre</em>, those wonderful Surprizes,
which are produc’d by Accidents that seem fortuitous,
and yet nevertheless have Causes assign’d
to them, which are certain. Again, it is
to be noted, that the <em>Prologue</em> should be plac’d
before the Play; but <em>Plautus</em> hath took the Liberty
of the <em>Greeks</em>, in placing the Prologue in
the Play, as particularly in the first Act of his
<em>Miles gloriosus</em>, and after the first Act in <em>Cistellaria</em>;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
however, as I hint above, this Custom
ought not to be follow’d by any prudent and
regular Poet; and therefore <em>Terence</em> hath took
Care not to be guilty of so great a Fault.
The <em>Catastrophe</em> of a Play must be happy or fatal;
but <em>Euripides</em> has made his Pieces to have
a miserable one, wherefore he appears to be the
most tragical of all the <em>Poets</em>. Now the Use of
Machines, which makes the Gods and Goddesses
appear upon the Stage, is founded on the
generally received Opinion of the <em>Ethnichs</em>, who
suppose the Gods can see all things, and take
Care of Men; for if there were none but <em>Epicureans</em>
in the World, the Machines would be
ridiculous, or not suffer’d, because they would
directly thwart their Opinion, in affirming the
Gods lead a quiet Life, free from all Sorts of
Care, and if <em>Nature</em> sometimes doth those
Things which seem miraculous, the Gods take
no Notice of it, and don’t interrupt their Pleasure.
By the Way also I must note, that the
Imitation of Lightning and Thunder may be
put into the Number of the Machines, and also
that furious Storm, which makes the unravelling
of the second <em>Oedipus</em> in <em>Sophocles</em>; for altho’
<em>Jupiter</em> doth not appear, yet ’tis he who
sends that Tempest, during which <em>Oedipus</em> is buried:
And from hence I infer, that Machines
may be employ’d, not only out of, but also in
the Action of Tragedy, provided there be an
absolute Necessity for them.</p>

<p>But many of our modern <em>Dramatists</em> have
not exactly observ’d the aforesaid Discourse, or
kept themselves strictly to the Unity of Action,
Time, and Place. For <em>Shakespear</em> in his Tragedy
of <em>Othello</em>, the <em>Moor</em> of <em>Venice</em>, makes the
Duration of what he represents to be above 3<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
Weeks or a Month; I think the Representation
of his Play begins in <em>Italy</em>, whence his black
General went to <em>Cyprus</em>, an Island on the Coast
of <em>Syria</em>, and to which he could not well arrive
under a Fortnight, according as the Storm he
met with held longer or shorter. The Absurdities
and Blunders of this illiterate <em>Poetaster</em>
being so many, that whatever he writ was not
worth acting in <em>Bartholomew</em> Fair, I shall only
take Notice of the little Knowledge he had in
<em>Astronomy</em>, when in Act 1. Scen. 2. he says,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">For do but stand upon the foaming Shore,</div>
<div class="verse">The chiding Billows seem to pelt the Clouds,</div>
<div class="verse">The Wind shake Surge, with high and monst’rous Main,</div>
<div class="verse">Seems to cast Water on the burning Bear,</div>
<div class="verse">And quench the Guards of the ever-fired Pole.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">In these Lines I reckon he hath given a false
<em>Epithet</em> to the <em>Bear</em>, which ought to have been
<em>lesser</em> instead of <em>burning</em>, by talking of the <em>Guards</em>
presently after, which are the two foremost
Stars in <em>Ursa minor</em>, whereof that which is in
the Shoulder of this Constellation, hath Longitude
128 Degrees, 23 Minutes, and North Latitude
72 Degrees, 40 Minutes, insomuch that
being nearest of all the Northern Constellations
to the North Pole, I wonder how there
can be any extraordinary Heat within the frigid
Zone. Also in the same Play he supposes
the Soul to be the Production of some mortal
Substance, according to these Words of <em>Emilia</em>,
Act 5. Scen. 1.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">If he say so, may his pernicious Soul</div>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p class="noindent">But <em>Shakespear</em> being no Scholar, I suppose he
had so little Skill in <em>Rhetorick</em>, that by a <em>Synecdoche</em>
he did not put a <em>Whole</em> for a Part, as <em>Virgil</em>
do’s <em>Anima</em> for <em>Homo</em>, in describing the Funeral
of <em>Polydorus</em>, in <em>Æneid. lib. 3</em>. The Faults
of this same <em>Poetaster</em> are not a few also in his
<em>Tragedy</em>, call’d <em>Hamlet</em>, Prince of <em>Denmark</em>; in
which he is mighty drolling, particularly where
he tells an old Woman’s Story of the Cocks
crowing always at <em>Christmas</em>, in Act 1. Scen. 1.</p>

<p>Truly Mr. <em>Lee</em> was in my Opinion, the most
exact of all our modern <em>Dramatists</em> in his
Plays; but yet he is not without his Irregularities
and Foibles, especially in religious Matters,
of which we shall only take notice of this in his
<em>Tragedy</em> call <em>Theodosius</em>, or the Force of Love,
where, in Act 3. Scen. 1. he represents the Emperor
<em>Theodosius</em> a hopeful Convert, when at the
sight of <em>Athenais</em> he makes one of the Articles
of the Christian Faith a <em>Simile</em> for his Cod-piece
Passion in these Words,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>In Mr. <em>Lee</em>’s Tragedy call’d the Rival Queens,
or the Death of <em>Alexander</em> the Great, in Act 1.
Scen. I. he makes <em>Polyperchon</em> give a Description
of Hell after the <em>Christian</em> Manner; for tho’ it
was the <em>Theology</em> of the <em>Grecians</em> to believe a future
State, yet it does not occur to my Memory
that I ever read they allotted any Punishment
to the Wicked by Fire, as he intimates in
these Lines.</p>

<div class="verse">Or sink my self for ever.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">And in Act 4. Scen. I. he introduces <em>Cassander</em>
speaking so prophanely, that it must rather vitiate
the Audience than make them virtuous.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="verse">’Tis nobler far to be a King of Hell,</div>

<div class="verse">And without Mischief have eternal Rest.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>As for Mr. <em>Shadwell</em>, he hath mixt his Tragedy
call’d the <em>Libertine</em> with so much Comedy, that
the Play is rather tragi-comical than tragical;
tho’ there is Blood enough spilt in it which
might, with good Husbandry, serve very well
for two or three Tragedies: But to make Don
<em>John</em> the Libertine talk of a Soul in Act I. when
an Atheist believes no such Thing existing in a
Man, it is very absurd, as you may see in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
following Lines, which plainly describe the Person’s
Character.</p>

<p>Was I to criticise on all the Errors occurring
in the <em>Greek</em>, <em>Latin</em> and <em>English</em> Dramatists, I
should swell my Criticisms to a Bulk exceeding
these swelling Expressions of <em>Seneca</em>, in the
first Act of his <em>Hercules Oetæus</em>, whom he makes
to speak in these bragging, bouncing, and ranting
Strains.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Vel si times ne terra concipiat feras,</div>
<div class="verse">Properet malum quodcunque dum terra Herculem</div>

<div class="verse">Da, da tuendos Jupiter saltem deos:</div>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>By these Lines we plainly see how miserable
<em>Jupiter</em> must be, who cannot be safe from wild
Beasts without an <em>Hercules</em>; and then again
how little and weak the <em>Poet</em> makes the Gods, in
representing them to stand in Need of Human
Help: But the tragick <em>Poets</em> do very often err
in this Manner, by extolling Things above Nature.
Moreover, altho’ some Morality may be
learnt by the Judicious either from tragick or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
comick Writers, yet there are none of the
dramatick Poets but what have too much Immorality
and Prophaness in their Writings;
and hence it follows that either <em>Tragedy</em> or <em>Comedy</em>,
as being a Representation of Things,
must be of a more pernicious Consequence than
an <em>Epick</em> Poem, which is only a Recitation. A
dramatick <em>Poet</em> must make the Person which he
brings on the Stage to speak exactly to the Character
which he or she represents: Thus whether
the Person that represents another, is to
act the Part of a Tyrant, Adulterer, Villain,
Drunkard, or any other wicked profligate
Wretch, as the Humour of such Persons must
be represented always the same, without any
Variety, the Representation of such notorious
Crimes may be of an ill Consequence to green
Heads; and especially in being Spectators of
such Plays, which treat of those Subjects whose
Stories are taken from, or belonging to Hell.
Farthermore there is as much Buffoonry and
Drollery acted on the <em>Irish</em> Stage as on the <em>English</em>
Stage, as having <em>Harlequins</em> shewing <em>Merry-Andrew</em>’s
Tricks; <em>Scaramouches</em> jumping into
Barrels; Dame <em>Ragonda</em> skipping about with 9
Brats at her Heels; or a brainless Fellow, who
has more Grimace than Sense, riding upon an
Ass, which (I’m sure) is false Heraldry to put
Metal upon Metal.</p>

<p>But being as soon tir’d of <em>Dublin</em>, as a <em>Drury-Lane</em>
Strumpet is of Beetle and Punny in
<em>Bridewell</em>, I left that lewd Town to visit the
Country; accordingly I went to <em>Manooth</em>, a
Town in the County of <em>Kildare</em>, where I saw
nothing memorable, but an old Castle much
ruinated by the famous Usurper <em>Oliver Cromwell</em>,
of inglorious Memory. Hence I went to <em>Kilcock</em>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
a Mile beyond which is a Stone-Mill, said
to be built by the Devil; and truly by its
strange Contrivance, I’m apt to believe it may
be the Workmanship of some infernal Artist.
Four Miles forward is <em>Clenard</em>, on the Skirts of
which Town is a Bridge over the River <em>Boyn</em>;
memorable for the entire Defeat King <em>William</em>
gave his Royal Competitor for the Diadem of
three Kingdoms. Hence I went to <em>Mullingar</em>;
and from thence to <em>Balimore</em>, otherwise call’d
<em>Balimore-Lough-Sunderland</em>, or <em>Sivedelie</em>, in the
County of <em>West-Meath</em>; but how improper the
Derivation is in one Respect, as well as incredulous
in another, I leave to your judicious
Sense to determine; for <em>Bali</em> signifies a Town
in the <em>Bogtrotters Jargon</em>, and <em>More</em>, great;
which <em>Epithet</em> is not at all suitable to this Place,
when there are scarce 40 Houses in it. But then
again to name it <em>Sunderland</em>, or <em>Sivedelie</em>, which
signifies a Beetle to beat wet Linnen, the Accident
I am going to recite, methinks could not
impose upon the Faith of any but a <em>Papist</em>, who
makes Traditions an essential Part of his <em>Credo</em>;
for as I was inform’d by some dwelling here,
there goes a Story of a Maid, living in former
Ages, when a Grove grew where this Lough
now is, on the North Side of the Town, with
a small Brook running thro’ it; and one Day
washing in this solitary Place, and accidentally
dropping her Beetle into the Water, the Trees
in the Grove instantly vanished, and the Ground
became a large Lough: Thus by giving too
much Credulity to a Lie, this Town begot a
Name as long as a <em>Spanish</em> Nobleman’s. In
the Church-Yard here I took Notice of a Grave-stone,
on which was this insignificant Inscription:
<i>Pray for the Soul of Major <em class="antiqua">John Duneel</em>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
who departed the 6th of <em class="antiqua">November</em>, 1694; as also
for his Wife <em class="antiqua">Elizabeth Jones</em>; and his Sons <em class="antiqua">Henry</em>,
<em class="antiqua">William</em> and <em class="antiqua">Richard</em>, who caused this Tomb to be
made, <em class="antiqua">Anno Domini</em> 1696.</i> And under it carv’d
<em>J. H. S.</em> the Initial Letters of, <em>Iesus Hominum
Salvator</em>. Not far from this is another Grave
stone over a Miller, with all the chief Tools of
his thieving Occupation carv’d thereon: And
this Mode I saw was pretty customary among
Tradesmen in many Church-Yards in this
Kingdom.</p>

<p>Next I went to <em>Athlone</em>, a Town not only situated
in the two Provinces of <em>Leinster</em> and
<em>Connought</em>, but also in the two Counties of <em>West-Meath</em>
and <em>Roscommon</em>. The <em>Shannon</em>, the largest
River in <em>Ireland</em>, running from North to South,
divides it into two Parts; over which is a Stone
Bridge, containing seven Arches, built by old
Queen <em>Bess</em>; and on it is cut out a Man and
Dog with this Inscription. <i><em class="antiqua">Robarts Damport</em>
Was Overseer of this Workys.</i> Indeed, the Matter
is not so material as to be worthy of communicating
it to the Publick, but only to let
my Readers see their antient way of Spelling,
which is not much different from the modern
<em>Orthography</em> now in use among ’em; and to delineate
the Arrogancy of this petty Officer,
who, because <em>Alexander</em> the Great respected his
Horse <em>Bucephalus</em>, attempted to immortalize his
<em>Irish</em> Cur too. Hence I went to <em>Balidagon</em>, a little
Village six Miles from <em>Athlone</em>; but whence
this Place takes its Name I cant imagine, unless
a Remnant of the cursed <em>Philistines</em> made their
Escape from the Slaughtering <em>Israelites</em>, by
Swimming over the Sea; and settling in this
bye Country, they dedicated these Receptacles
of Poverty to their Monstrous God, <em>Dagon</em>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
Proceeding onwards on my Pilgrimage, I went
to <em>Balinasloe</em>; the People of which small Town
are so Zealous, that rather than want a House
of Devotion, they assemble in a little Cabbin,
where a Bank is raised for the Bog-trotting
Congregation to sit on; and such an awkward
Pulpit, Desk, and Communion-Table is bestow’d
on the poor <em>Levite</em>, that it would puzzle Ingenuity
to fathom the Depth of humane Fancy for
their true Description: However, taking some
Pity and Compassion on these godly Wretches,
before I left ’em I compil’d for them the following

<p>Bidding adieu to <em>Balinosloe</em>, I went to <em>Aghrim</em>,
where the Number of Houses exceed not
a Pair-Royal of Aces; however, the Place will
be ever memorable in History, for the decisive
Battle fought here, which reduced a whole
Kingdom to the Obedience of the <em>Protestant</em>
King <em>William</em>. And all over the Plain here lie
scatter’d Heaps of Mens Sculls to this Day; insomuch
that it does not only represent <em>Golgotha</em>,
but had also the Father of that <em>Grecian</em>
Hero dwelt here, who wept for more Worlds
to add to his Conquests, he might have sav’d his
Page the Labour of shewing him at Meals the
ghastful Emblem of Mortality. Hence I proceeded
to <em>Loghrea</em>, where is kept the chiefest
Market in all the Province of <em>Connaught</em>; and
from thence going to <em>Killilel</em>, I saw a small
wooden Cross set tottering upon a Heap of
Stones in the Road; about which some Priest,
and his bigotted Tribe, had been mumbling a
<em>Pater Noster</em>, and <em>Ave Maria</em> to the Blessed
Lady. At <em>Balihavely</em> I took Notice of an old
Castle metamorphosed into a Cow-House;
and next I went to <em>Athenrea</em>, an ancient, but
much ruinated Town, built by old King <em>John</em>
of merry Memory. Then I came to <em>Galway</em>, a
large Seaport Town, situated on the River
<em>Caarle</em>; when I first enter’d this Place, I really
took it to be a general Goal for the whole
Kingdom; for the Houses (which are some
one, some two, and some three Stories high)
are all strongly built of Stone, and most of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
Windows thick barricadoed with thick Iron
Bars, insomuch that there are not the like Buildings
to be seen through the Country for
Strength. In the Midst of this Town stands a
Church, dedicated to honest St. <em>Nicholas</em>, whose
Steeple hath a pretty good Set of Bells, and its
Chimes are somewhat Musical, but not well approv’d
by the <em>Fanaticks</em>, because they are set to
the Tune of a <em>Psalm</em>. Moreover, in this Church
are two Pulpits, one for the Doctor to preach
in, and one for the Archbishop of <em>Tuam</em>, in case
his Preferment makes him not above it.</p>

<p>The Women of this Country are generally
so homely, that had the Mother of all
Living been as ugly, when she took her ill-condition’d
Being from one of Father <em>Adam</em>’s
Ribs, her frightful Phisiognomy had forc’d
the Godhead to act the sixth Day over again.
Seeing the female Sex so ordinary, to comfort
them under this Misfortune, I composed the
following Lines, call’d the Picture of an <em>Irish</em>
Woman.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="verse indent1">Of all the Creatures I have ever found,</div>

</div>

<p>But yet for all this Dearth of handsome Women,
this Country in another Respect is far
happier than <em>England</em>, as being less infected
with <em>Lawyers</em>, that common Bane of all Mankind.
The wild <em>Irish</em>, in all Courts of Judicature,
are sworn upon a Scull; herein being
more scrupulous of forswearing themselves,
than by taking a false Oath on the <em>New-Testament</em>;
as supposing the Ghost to whom that
Scull once pertain’d would haunt them, in case
they prov’d perjur’d. Assizes are held twice a
Year for criminal Matters, and Cases of <em>Nisi
prius</em>; and tho’ <em>Astræa</em> left no Print of her Footsteps
in this Nation when she fled to Heaven,
yet so partial is blindfold Justice here betwixt
Man and Beast, that the Stone Pounds for offending
Cattle seem stronger built than Goals
for Malefactors. Murderers are hang’d and
quarter’d; and <em>Rapparees</em> share the same Fate:
Which last in former Times was the <em>Militia</em> of
the Country, but the mean Souls of the <em>Irish</em>
detesting now what is honourable and Praiseworthy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
to follow Theft, this martial Denomination
suffers the same hard Fate with those
honest Names of <em>Tyrant</em> and <em>Sophister</em>, which
from Titles of Honour are degenerated into
Terms of the greatest Disgrace and Infamy;
for a <em>Rapparee</em> now signifies no more than a
Robber on the Highway. As for the great
Commerce the People drives, that was plainly
perceiv’d by meeting neither Waggon nor Pack-Horse
100 Miles an End. The wild Native
<em>Irish</em> observe more Days of Fasting and Abstinence
than the Rubrick of their Church enjoyns
them; because extream Poverty excludes them
from the Use of Flesh and Fowl from one Year’s
End to another. Their Lodging is in small
Cabbins, without Chimneys, put up in the
Highways; and in these the Man, his Wife and
Children, Cocks, Hens, Chickens, Hogs, Pigs,
Cows, Calves and Geese lie all together. If
<em>Teague</em> is so topping as to rent a small Potatoe-Garden
for 5 Shillings <em>per Annum</em>, he thinks
himself as well to pass as that <em>Italian</em> Duke,
who’s married Yearly to the <em>Adriatic</em> Sea; however,
his Tenement shall be no better furnish’d
than the rest of his Neighbours; which is commonly
set off with a Truss of Straw to lie on,
a Grid-Iron, and Pot to boil <em>Potatoes</em>. These
wild People wear neither Shoes nor Stockings,
which makes me strongly to suspect that they
are born without any, as Monsieur <em>Ragou</em>’s Bastard
was without a Shirt; and as often as I
behold their tatter’d Apparel, which scarce
covers what Modesty ought to conceal, I imagine
them to proceed from the Loyns of <em>Ham</em>,
who discovering his Father’s Nakedness, the
Curse of him and his Posterity lay in never being
well cloath’d again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>Here are no Stage-Coaches; and instead of
Carts they use only little Cars, with small
Wheels without Spokes, so that they cannot
carry above 3 or 400 Weight of Tallow, which
is one of the chiefest Commodities of this Country.
Sliding Carts are also very common, imitating
much our Halliers in <em>Bristol</em>. Instead of
Soap they use <em>Cackmacrel</em>, that is, the Excrements
of Dogs whether thick or thin, which
poor Women gather up in the Streets with as
great Pains as they do Rags in <em>London</em>. In <em>England</em>
Women ride upon the left Side of a Horse,
but here they ride upon the wrong Side; and
very often astride. Most Things edible or potable
are very cheap; but why is that? Because
Money is scarce, which makes an <em>English</em>
Shillings go for 13 Pence, and a Guinea 1 Pound
3 Shillings, which is considerable above their
intrinsick Value. The Inhabitants of this Kingdom
greatly admire a Dish of Potatoes, to which
they have such an Appetite, that I believe they
long for ’em after they are dead; for in most
Potatoe-Gardens many Souls, grinning strangely
at this delicious Food, which is both Bread
and Meat to an <em>Irishman</em>; but whether they get
thither by Accident, or some sympathetical
Vertue, whose strange Effect proceeding from
as strange a Cause, the Relicks of their mortal
Carcasses will insensibly creep (like the Sun’s
Shadow on a Dial) to what they most affected
in this Lite, is a Subject on which I shall not
insist. For above 40 Miles together I could not
see a Stack of Hay; and Beasts are very small
here, excepting the Woman, who being great
Breeders, stand hard and fast by that primary
Command, <em>Increase and multiply</em>; but I suppose
their Obedience to this Precept is more by natural<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
Instinct, than acquir’d by any Knowledge
of the Scriptures, to which they are as meer
Strangers as the remotest Heathens. So boggy
is most part of the Country, that if it is not
<em>Lucifer</em>’s Backside, one may very reasonably
impute it to be the grand Magazine of Nature’s
Impurity. Popery is very predominant; for
altho’ severe Acts are made against Jesuits,
Monks, and Fryers, yet secular Priests, who
own no Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction of the See of
<em>Rome</em>, are tolerated to say Mass. Besides, several
private Nunneries, the <em>Papists</em> have public
Chapels here; one about a Furlong or two
without the West-Gate of <em>Galway</em>, dedicated to
the Virgin <em>Mary</em>; and another a little without
Abby-Gate, dedicated to St. <em>Francis</em>. Superstition
has a great Ascendant over their Faith;
for about half a Mile without <em>William</em>’s Gate
are two Wells, dedicated to the blessed Lady
and St. <em>Tavison</em>, round which every <em>Sunday</em> Morning
they walk bare-foot an Hour together,
mumbling over their Beads, and then crossing
themselves with the Water, which they hold
to be good against several Infirmities, they return
home as little sanctified as they went.
The Pulpit-Prayers us’d by the <em>Protestant</em> Clergy
in <em>Ireland</em>, are scarce as long as the Lord’s Prayer
and Doxology; for they are all as idle as
our <em>English</em> Parsons, who don’t preach, but read
Sermons, excepting here and there one that
scorns to teach his Congregation out of a
Book.</p>

<p>From <em>Galway</em> I went to <em>Carmorris</em>, on the
left Hand whereof are several Houses paying
Tribute to the Ruins of Fire and Sword. Next
I went to <em>Balihove</em>, in the County of <em>Mayo</em>;
and truly of all the <em>Irish</em> Counties commend me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
to this for good Fellowship; for here they will
kill one another to raise a Rundlet of <em>Aqua-vitæ</em>.
As passing through this Country, I overtook a
little Car loaded with this Liquor, which they
prefer above their beloved <em>Usquebaugh</em>, drawing
before a Corpse; and as soon as the senseless
Clod was interr’d in an obscure Place among
Bogs and Hills, they fell heartily to their strong
Sippings, which they drew out into square
wooden Cups, and thence took it out agen with
Egg-shels, which serv’d instead of Tasters.
For my part being a Stranger, they invited me
to participate of their Liquor; accordingly I
tarried with them, to see their Manners; ’till
the Spirits flew so much into their Heads, that
one Brother in a Quarrel kill’d another. Hereupon
some were for carrying him to Justice,
and others again for hiding the bloody Fact;
thus whilst a long Controversie held concerning
what to do in this tragical Matter, an old
Man among ’em starts up, and addresses himself
as follows.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Loving Friends and Acquaintance, in taking
our last Farewel of a Neighbour here
departed, the Funeral Meeting has unhappily
occasion’d the Loss of another. Now
if we should deliver up this Criminal to the
Government, the Severity of their Justice
will deprive us of a third Friend; which Punishment
will not retrieve the Life of his unfortunate
Brother. Wherefore, to prevent
the Survivor’s untimely End, we’ll presently
send to see what Goods and Chattles the Deceased
owns; and raising therewith another
Rundlet of <em>Aqua-vitæ</em>, we’ll privately bury
our lately departed Brother, and drink his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
<em>Requiem</em>, without taking any farther Notice
of this Disaster to our heretical Foes”.</p>

</div>

<p>These were his Words as near as I can remember,
and his Advice being applauded by
all the Auditors, another Rundlet of <em>Aqua Vitæ</em>
is fetc’d; but by that time it was near out, a
fresh Quarrel arose, wherein a second Person
was murder’d; which being likewise smother’d
and a fresh Rundlet of <em>Aqua Vitæ</em> procur’d, I
took my leave of these kind Heats, for fear
they should at last raise a drunken Collation
out of me. So I made the best of my way for
<em>Foxford</em>, a very large Town, with a Church in
it, lying among very high Hills. Hence I went
to <em>Lorras</em>, an excellent Harbour for Ships, situated
in a Bay, twining among exceeding
high Mountains. Thence I went to <em>Sligo</em>, which
hath a strong Citadel, by a Bridge containing
Eight Stone Arches. Hence I went to <em>Grange</em>;
from thence to <em>Balishannon</em>, a Seaport Town;
hence I went to <em>Donnegal</em>, a Town situated on
a Hill, and was burnt by the Duke of <em>Berwick</em>,
in the late <em>Irish</em> Wars. Hence I went over
<em>Barnsmoor</em>, a Mount Ten Miles in Length, in
the Province of <em>Ulster</em>; but about a Mile before
I came to the End of it, <em>Colcrockeda</em> [or the
Hangman’s] Wood begins; where a great many
<em>Tories</em> or <em>Rapparees</em> have been hang’d, when
they made their solitary Receptacles in this desolate
and dangerous Place for robbing. Hence
I went to <em>Rapho</em>, a Bishoprick, with a very little
Church in it. And next I went to <em>London-Derry</em>,
the People whereof have such good Stomachs
as to eat Cats, Rats, Dogs and Horse-flesh
in time of a Siege. The most remarkable
Thing I saw hereabout was the Gallows, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
stands about half a Mile out of Town, and is
of a Triangular Form, like our Triple-Tree
at <em>Hyde-Park</em> Corner; but as yet has not honour’d
the <em>Roman</em> See with so many Saints and
Martyrs as that in <em>England</em>.</p>

<p>From <em>London-Derry</em> I went to <em>Colrain</em>, a Seaport
Town divided by the <em>Byrne</em> Water into
Two Parts, so that it stands in the Counties of
<em>Derry</em> and <em>Antrim</em>, which last Shire is much
haunted with Fairies, who are so mischievous
as to fling Darts at People as they Travel in the
Night. I saw one of ’em, which is a flat solid
Stone, about Two Inches long, and in Shape
like a Vamp or upper Leather of a Woman’s
pecked Toe Shoe; one side white, t’other inclining
to the same Colour, but speckled with
red Spots; and is reckon’d very medicinal, if
us’d according to Prescription, for the sore
Teats of Cows. The <em>Irish</em> People, I perceiv’d
all the Way I Travell’d, are haughty of Heart,
implacable in Enmity; light of Belief, and patient
<em>per</em> Force in Hunger and Cold. <em>Damage-fesant</em>
is seldom committed, because here are
few or no Hedges; nor can Forrest Laws be in
much Use, when I saw not one from one End
of the Kingdom to the other. Brogues are
more worn than Shoes by both Sexes; their
Mouths supply the Use of Bellows; a Pail of
Water serves ’em for a Looking-Glass; and
Cleanliness is as much unknown to them, as
the Discoveries of <em>Christopher Columbus</em> to the
Antients. The richer Sort of Women wear
blue Cloth Cloaks, in all Weathers, as a Type
or Symbol of their Desire of wearing the
Breeches too; but their Husbands to mar their
Intentions, generally wear Trowsers made of
Frize, which is the staple Commodity of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
Country. The midling Rank of Women wear
Riding-Hoods; and the Poor ones clad themselves
with course Mantles, thrown over their
Kerchiefs, which are as black as their Bodies,
and their Bodies as black as their Souls, but yet
their Souls are blacker than either; if it was
but for their Malice, contrary to the <em>11th</em> Commandment,
commanding, <em>That ye love one
another</em>.</p>

<p>Tho’ the Women differ in their Habits, yet
both Gentle and Simple count Decency in Dressing
meer Idolatry; and that their Stockings
may hang flatteringly about their Heels, they
have utterly forsworn the Use of Garters.
Those who are married are generally dull and
sottish, so that when their Husbands come
home, they look like so many Passion-Pictures,
presenting ever Sadness and Melancholly; which
makes the poor Cuckolds like <em>Spaniards</em>, who
will leave their Saviour at any Time for a Maidenhead,
look as dull. Yea, an <em>Irishman</em> loves
a Whore as well as a <em>Frenchman</em>; and tho’ the
Superstition of former Times accounted a Woman
of such Pollution, that the Council of <em>Eliberis</em>
would not suffer a Man to touch her three
Days before his receiving the Sacrament, yet in
Defiance of all Councils, they will forsake Sacraments,
and all things else holy, rather than
go without a Bit of old Hat: And this Practice
of abstaining from Women at certain Times,
was (I suppose) in Use among the antient Heathens,
according to this Caution of <em>Tibullus</em>.</p>

<p>By this Question in the last Chapter of <em>Proverbs</em>,
as I take it, <em>Who can find a virtuous Woman?</em>
One would be apt to surmise that <em>Solomon</em>
had travell’d into this Country; and to see the
People eat Clover Grass, a Man might swear
’em all a-kin to grazing <em>Nebuchadnezzar</em>. The
Genius of the <em>Irish</em> is not a-whit admirable, for
one Age here grows not wiser than another,
like other Nations; which gives great Suspicion
of a <em>Metempsischosis</em>, or <em>Pythagoras</em>’s Transmigration
of the Soul to be true: Seeing, by the Conversation
I had among the Bogtrotters, that the
younger Folks only inherit the small Sense of
their Progenitors; whose profound Knowledge
was heretofore so great, as to tye Ploughs to
their Horses Tails. Their Bogs are many,
whence they have all their Fuel, for they burn
nothing but Turf; Spiders are very plentiful,
but not venomous; and the common Texture
spun out of their Intrails, makes a Sort of
Hangings, which the <em>Irish</em> for Cheapness prefer
much before good Tapestry. In some Parts
they make their Bread with the Bark of Holly,
from which tearing off the green Superfluities,
they work it up round like a Football, and bake
it in the Embers. Their Butter being mixt
with Salt and Garlick, and put into the Skin
which follows the Calf from the Cow, they bury
in a Turf-Pit for 8 or 9 Months together,
which does not only make it of a strong Taste,
but likewise dies it with all the Colours in the
Rainbow: And Briskins, or the Roots of wild
Tansie, they love as well. Tho’ the Streets in
every Town are very dirty, yet their Scavengers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
Carts are no bigger than Wheelbarrows;
and the Use of Clogs or Pattins is an Abomination
with most Women. The most epidemical
Distemper among Strangers is the bloody Flux;
for which, Eggs fry’d in Brandy is a good <em>Catholicon</em>.
Few or no Patients happen among the
lying-in Women; for (like the <em>Hebrews</em>, as
their pious Midwives pretended) they are
brought to Bed without any Help; wash and
do all without Nurses; and in less than half a
Week do not only go abroad, but also give Earnest
for being with Child again. Their newborn
Infants are as hardy, and will endure Cold
as well as any <em>Laplander</em>; or the strongest Bear
subject to the Czar of <em>Muscovy</em>. The <em>Irish</em> Soil
mimicks Nature like the vivifying Mud of <em>Nile</em>;
for I have seen the Hairs which fall from Horses
Tails into Puddles of Water on the Road,
transubstantiated (if I may be so bold as to use
that Word, without any Offence to his Unholiness
the Pope) into Worms; wherefore it is
no Wonder that Priests, by the Art of <em>Legerdemain</em>,
can convert good Bread and Wine into
real Flesh and Blood.</p>

<p><em>Jack-Daws</em> here are not black, but white and
grey, like <em>Royston</em> Crows; and <em>Sea-Gulls</em> are all
white, except their Wings, which are tipt at
the End with a dark yellow; but the largest
Birds in this Kingdom are <em>Whores-Birds</em> and
<em>Jay!-Birds</em>. Here is a sort of Vermin
breeding near Bogs call’d <em>Man-creepers</em>; in
Shape and Bigness like a <em>Lizard</em>, having 4 Legs,
the two foremost of which bear the Resemblance
of a Human Hand. This Creature’s Property
is to creep into a Man’s Belly, if he finds him
sleeping with his Mouth open, where he extreamly
tortures him, ’till fetch’d out of his internal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
Habitation; which Operation is thus
perform’d. The Patient being kept fasting, his
Chyrurgeon baits a Hook with a Piece of Meat,
and puts it down his Throat, at which the
hungry Insect snapping, he pulls him out with
a sudden Jerk, and kills it. Milk will not keep
(do what they can) from turning sour in six
Hours at any time of the Year; but why this
Region can’t preserve this Sweetness longer, is
somewhat paradoxical to me; unless the invisible
<em>Effluvia</em>’s, which secretly dissipate themselves
from the unwholsome Fogs, arising out
of the Bogs, by the attractive Power of the
Sun’s Beams, assume the Prerogative of forcing
the Putrefaction, so common to the liquid Product
of the Cow’s Teat. An <em>Ignis fatuus</em> the
silly People deem to be a Soul broke out of <em>Purgatory</em>;
and on the Vigil of St. <em>John</em> the <em>Baptist</em>’s
Nativity they make Bonfires, and run along
the Streets and Fields with Wisps of
Straw blazing on long Poles to purify the Air,
which they think infectious, by believing all the
Devils, Spirits, Ghosts, and Hobgoblins fly abroad
this Night to hurt Mankind. Farthermore,
it is their dull <em>Theology</em> to affirm, the
Souls of all People leave their Bodies on the
Eve of this Feast, and take a Ramble to that
very Place where, by Land or Sea, a final Seperation
shall divorce them for evermore in this
World. As soon as Death brings his last Summons
to any one, the wild <em>Irish</em> (both Men,
Women and Children) go before the Corpse,
and from his or her House to the Church-yard
set up a most hideous Holoo loo loo, which
may be heard two or three Miles round the
Country. Now when a Virgin (if here’s any
such Thing after she’s in the Teens) dies, a Garland,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
made of all sorts of Flowers and sweet
Herbs, is carried by a young Woman on her
Head, before the Coffin, from which hang
down two black Ribbons, signifying our mortal
State; and two white, as an Emblem of Purity
and Innocence; the Ends thereof are held by 4
young Maids, which are not so plenty here as
<em>Thornbacks</em>, before whom a Basket full of Herbs
and Flowers is supported by 2 other Maids,
who strew them along the Streets to the Place
of Burial: Then after the Deceased follow all
her Relations, and Acquaintance. But the
Priest being asham’d to walk without his <em>Pontificalibus</em>,
he’s as invisible, ’till you come to the
Grave, as if he had the Ring of <em>Gyges</em> on his
Finger.</p>

<p>Peas, Beans, and Artichoaks are very scarce;
but what is worse, their Beef will not take
Salt, without all the Fat melting away. The
Inhabitants in general thinking Adultery and
Fornication more laudable, than drawing the
Picture of Posterity in the lawful State of Matrimony,
the <em>Morbus gallicus</em> is as fashionable
all over the Country, as in any Court in <em>Europe</em>;
nevertheless, it is no Miracle to see them
look fair to the last, since they drink nothing
but what Nature’s Liberality is pleas’d to bestow
on ’em at Springs. Children that are
troubled with Kibes are always in a sad Condition,
because their poor Parents being great
Strangers to any sort of salted Meat, they
have no Brine to Cure them. When they use
Phlebotomy they frequently bleed ill Blood, because
it always runs in their Veins; and an
<em>Apoplexy</em> seldom kills them, because they are
not much pamper’d with high Feeding. A
<em>Dropsie</em> does not much hurt an <em>Irishman</em>, by reason<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
he naturally swells with his Rhodomontado’s,
and bragging Lies: But a deep <em>Consumption</em>
always affects most their Pockets. Tho’
all their Actions are evil, yet are they not
much afflicted with the <em>King’s-Evil</em>; nor are
they much troubled with the <em>Gout</em>, because their
Poverty does not qualifie them for it. I can’t
tell what an <em>Imposthume</em> may do, but a Lie will
never choak them; nor do they seem to have
the <em>Palsie</em>, but when a bad Conscience makes
’em quake and tremble like an Aspin Leaf: But
indeed the People are all most grievously infected
with the <em>Scurvy</em> and <em>Spleen</em> too. As for their
Houses, the Rooms up one pair of Stairs, or
higher, are cover’d with Earth 4 or 5 Inches
thick; and the Tenent of the Joyces are not
put into Mortises, but laid cross-wise into
Notches over the Summet. An <em>Irishman</em> and
Fool are Correlatives; or at least synonimous
Terms: And catch him without a Blunder,
which makes him love Bulls, ’tis to be fear’d
the World is near its Dissolution. They speak
largely of their Antiquity, boasting as if they
were a People before the Creation; but, in my
Opinion, <em>Ireland</em> could not well be <em>in esse</em> so
early, because e’er a powerful <em>Fiat</em> produc’d all
Things out of nothing, all Things lay in their
original <em>Chaos</em>, so I can’t imagine of what the
<em>Irish</em> could exist, unless they derive their Descent
from those <em>Atoms</em>, which by a casual Concourse
(as the <em>Epicureans</em> hold) jumping together,
gave Being to the World. Neither could
it be a Country at the first Dawn of Light, by
reason when Omnipotency had finisht his stupendious
Works, he said, <em>they were good</em>; and
the sacred Approbation was glorified by <em>all the
Sons of the Morning, who shouted together for Joy</em>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
Truly, I should rather impute the Original of
this Country to some Judgment, which stirring
up the Ocean, to overwhelm some remoter
Part of the Globe, whose aggravating Sins
too much incensed divine Justice, it left its antient
Current, to make room for a Place as
wicked: for you may read in divers Authors
of a Resurrection of Isles, peeping up in many
Parts, where none were ever seen before.</p>

<p>Their Language they do not only reckon older,
but also more copious than the <em>Hebrew</em>;
however, the Copiousness of their Linguo is
easily guess’d at, by not having a Word in their
Speech to express Breeches; and many other
appellative Words. Like the odious <em>French</em> they
put the <em>Substantive</em> before the <em>Adjective</em>, and to
embellish their Discourse, too often mixt with
<em>Tautology</em>, they frequently use the Figure <em>Hysteron
&amp; Proteron</em>, that is, putting the Cart before
the Horse. Their <em>Alphabet</em> contains but
these 17 Letters, <em>A</em>, <em>B</em>, <em>C</em>, <em>D</em>, <em>E</em>, <em>F</em>, <em>G</em>, <em>I</em>, <em>L</em>, <em>M</em>,
<em>N</em>, <em>O</em>, <em>P</em>, <em>R</em>, <em>S</em>, <em>T</em>, <em>U</em>; but this literal Paucity
(like the <em>Saxon</em> Abecedary) is supply’d with
some Abbreviations or Contractions. The Pronunciation
of their Tongue being somewhat
guttural, it is hard for the Vulgar to speak it;
harder to speak it significantly; and hardest to
write true. In the late King <em>James</em>’s Reign
an <em>Irish</em> Teaguish Priest mightily extolling this
Bogland Jargon, he as mightily interceeded
with his papistick Majesty to erect publick
Schools in <em>Oxford</em> and <em>Cambridge</em>, for professing
this Tongue; but an <em>Irish</em> Courtier, who had
no great Veneration for this conceited Pedlar
in holy Trinkets, requesting the King to command
him to translate, <em>Black Ox eat raw Egg</em>,
the Priest presently perform’d his Talk thus,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
<em>Daue dooue ecye ewe ouce</em>; at which inarticulate
Sounds (for if you was to hear them rightly
pronounc’d, they sound just like a Dog’s barking)
his Majesty bursted out a laughing, and
calling to his Dog <em>Towser</em>, said, <em>Here’s my Dog
can speak your Language already</em>; whereupon the
spiritual Jugler drew in his Horns, and sneak’d
off like a small Cur that had lost his Tail. In
their Discourse it is common for them to use
two Negatives, which I’m sure make an Affirmative;
unless, after the manner of the <em>Greeks</em>,
they use them to make the Negation stronger.
It has been a great Dispute among <em>Grammarians</em>,
whether an <em>Irishman</em> is a Noun <em>Substantive</em>, or a
Noun <em>Adjective</em>; but it is carried in the latter,
by reason he cannot stand by himself in Battle;
for before the <em>Irish</em> go abroad, you shall
not find greater Cowards under the Copes of
Heaven.</p>

<p>Why the Men and Women here should be so
unmercifully big in the Legs, above any other
People, I impute to their mean Food, making
no solid <em>Chyle</em>; so what slender Diet they eat,
descending into their lower Parts, it there settles
in a dropsical sort of a Humour. For all
this Climate is reckon’d wholesome, it is rare
to see any of the Natives past the climacterical
Year; and their Perfidiousness is commonly attended
with more Curses, in one respect or another,
than are read in the <em>Commination</em> by our
Clergy on <em>Ash Wednesday</em>. Such as have Pewter
take great Delight to have it furbelow’d with
Dust; and to wear clean Linnen they reckon as
great a Crime as Loyalty. The People (like
<em>Janus</em>) have not two Faces; but that they are
double-hearted is confirm’d by the Votes of all
moral Men: For thinking a sly deceiving their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
best Friends meritorious, is a general Rule
they hold without any Exception. Here few
Women die Martyrs for Love; but if they crave
the Affections of a Man, wholly averse to their
Inclination, their Endeavour to raise Enjoyment
of him is by Art; and to this end they
often use Philtres. Likewise, the Spark that’s
resolv’d to sacrifice his Youth and Vigour on a
Damsel, whose Coyness will not accept of his
Love-Oblations; he threads a Needle with the
Hair of her Head, and then running it thro’
the most fleshy Part of a dead Man, as the
Brawn of the Arms, Thigh, or Calf of the
Leg, the Charm has that Virtue in it, as to
make her run mad for him whom she so lately
slighted. Providence is very admirable in all
its Dispensations, of strangely bringing surprising
Accidents to pass; but more especially
in <em>Ireland</em>, is her Gubernation of Chances wonderful,
in preserving a People from starving,
whose short Commons, in most Places, make a
lively Representation of Famine. Their Skill
in painting comes not near the rude Draughts
of the boorish <em>Dutch</em>; whose Fancy is more
grotesque than natural: And their Churches
discover neither any Workmanship after the
old <em>Gothick</em> Fashion; nor shew the <em>Dorick</em>, <em>Corinthian</em>,
or other Orders of modern Architecture.
Also the Spaciousness of them may
be soon guess’d at by their Cathedrals, the
largest of which scarce exceeds <em>Oliver</em>’s Tabernacle,
or <em>Calamy</em>’s <em>Presbyterian</em> Meeting-House
in <em>Long Ditch</em> at <em>Westminster</em>.</p>

<p>This Country abounds with Foxes, and some
wild Deer; Curlues and Cuckolds; and many
Rooms in most Houses having no Chimnies,
one would take every Town to be a Vent of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
Mount <em>Ætna</em>, when the Smoak (which is enough
to stifle <em>Charon</em>) makes the Walls as black as
Hell: And because <em>Sarah</em> was buried in the
Field of <em>Macpelah</em>, some of the <em>Irish</em> have the
Ambition to be buried in open Places. The
People are so alike for Rags and Jags, that I
believe <em>Plautus</em> took his <em>Amphitryo</em> from them.</p>

<p>From <em>Colrain</em> I went to <em>Antrim</em>, thence to
<em>Belfast</em>, and thence to <em>Donaghadea</em>, where you
may dine at 12 at Noon, and by Water get
to <em>Port Patrick</em> in <em>Scotland</em>, by 3 in the Afternoon.
It being natural for the <em>Irishmen</em> to be
as Jealous as <em>Spaniards</em>, from whom they pretend
to be descended, they will not let their
Wives wear Smocks, to prevent their Neighbours
from taking up their Linnen; and if a
Man has a great Estate here, he cannot with
the <em>Psalmist</em> say, <em>My Liues are fallen to me in
pleasant Places</em>. The Hazel Wood in <em>Ireland</em> is
obnoxious to Snakes, which expire in the Circles
made with them; nor will a Toad, or any
other venomous Creature, live in this Clime:
But the Reason why the Soil is so blest, is because
the People are curst.</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">Returning from <em>Ireland</em> to
<em>England</em> again, and being still
of a roving Mind, I was dispos’d
to go to <em>Holland</em>, I think
it was on the longest Day in
the Year, call’d <em>Barnaby</em> bright,
when going down to <em>Margate</em> in the Isle of
<em>Thanet</em>, where <em>Austin</em> the Monk landed to convert
<em>Kentish</em> Infidels, I went on board the <em>Swiftsure</em>,
a third Rate Man of War, on which Admiral
<em>Shovel</em> had hoisted his Flag, in his convoying
King <em>William</em> then over to <em>Holland</em>. A
fair Wind favouring us, we soon arriv’d upon
the Coast of <em>Holland</em>, which I perceiv’d was so
low, that the People had the Advantage of
other Nations, for if they die in Perdition,
they have a shorter Cut to Hell than the rest
of their Neighbours.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>I landed at the <em>Briel</em> in the Isle of <em>Voorne</em>,
where is good Accommodation enough for
Travellers, but only they pay dear for it.
Hence I cross’d over the <em>Maes</em> River to the Isle
of <em>Roosenburg</em>, for 5 Stivers; and for 3 more I
cross’d over for <em>Vlaerding</em>, and by that Time I
got thither, I found the Ground so light all the
way, that a strong Earthquake would shake the
whole 17 Provinces of the <em>Netherlands</em> into a
<em>Chaos</em>. Most of their Dwellings in this Town,
as well as other Places, stand like Privies in
moated Houses, hanging still over the Water;
and had St. <em>Stephen</em> been condemn’d to suffer here,
he might have been alive this Day; for unless it
be their paved Cities, Gold is a little more plentiful
than Stones; except it be living ones, and
then for their Heaviness you may take in almost
all the Nation. It is a singular Place to fat
Monkies in, for there are Spiders as fat as
Shrimps; and a starting Horse endangers you
two Deaths at once, breaking your Neck and
drowning. <em>Holland</em> hanging most in the Water,
it seems but a Bridge of swimming Earth;
and if <em>Ætna</em> be the Mouth or fore Gate of Hell,
surely here is found the Postern, where the full
Earth doth vent her crude black Gore, which
the Inhabitants do scrape away for Fuel, as
Men with Spoons do Excrements from Civit
Cats. They dress their Meat <em>in Aqua cælesti</em>,
for it springs not as ours from the Earth, but
comes to them as <em>Manna</em> to the <em>Israelites</em> falling
from Heaven. This they keep under Ground
’till it stinks, and then they pump it out again
for Use; So when you wash your Face with one
Hand, you had need hold your Nose with the
other; for tho’ it be not a Cordial, yet is it certainly
a strong Water; and an <em>English</em> Bailiff<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
prefers it far beyond <em>Mint</em> Water. Their Ditches
they distinguish into Nooks, as my Lord
Mayor’s Cook does his Custards; and every
<em>Dutchman</em> being his own Herald, Escutcheons
are as plentiful among the Boors as Gentry is
scarce.</p>

<p>From <em>Vlaerding</em> I went to <em>Schiedam</em>, a small
Town abounding in Fishery; and where Abundance
of Busses, Cord, and Network is made.
Here entring a House, the first Thing (as in
other Houses) I encounter’d was a Looking-Glass
and next other Utensils of a Family,
marshalled about the Room like so many Watch-men.
Were the Knacks of all their Houses set
together, they would far exceed the Trumpery
of <em>Deard</em>’s Toyshop in <em>Fleet-street</em>, or the Court
of Requests; and if you want to speak <em>Dutch</em>,
you may learn a great deal from their Signs,
for what they are they always write under
them. Coaches and Carts are as rare as Comets;
and all their Merchandize they draw
through the Streets on Sledges, as we do our
Traytors on Hurdles to <em>Tyburn</em>. Their Rooms
being but as so many Sand-Boxes, you must either
go out to spit, or blush when you see the
Mop brought. As their Beds require a Ladder
or Stairs to get into ’em, you are in Danger of
breaking your Neck if you tumble out; and as
they keep their Houses cleaner than their Bodies,
so do they take Care to have their Bodies
cleaner than their Souls. They are not so
nice-conscioned, but that they can turn out
Religion to let in Policy; and a <em>Dutch</em> Woman,
being the Head of the Husband, she takes the
Horn to her own Charge, which she often
multiplies, and bestows the Increase on her
Man. The People are generally boorish, therefore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
their Country is the God they Worship,
War is their Heaven, Peace is their Hell, and
the <em>Spaniard</em>, the Devil they hate.</p>

<p>From <em>Schiedam</em> I went to <em>Rotterdam</em>, the second
great Emporium of this trading People,
situated on the Side and Banks of the <em>Maes</em>, and
fitted for all Conveniency of Transport and
Importation. Here, as in other Places, I found
I might sooner convert a <em>Jew</em>, than make a
<em>Dutchman</em> yield to Arguments that cross him,
because his Spirits are generated from <em>English</em>
Beer; and his Body is built of pickled Herring,
which makes him testy. If you see him
fat, he hath been rooting in a Cabbage Ground,
and that bladder’d him; he is as churlish as his
Breeder <em>Neptune</em>; and the Love of Gain is as
natural to him, as Water to a Goose, or Carrion
to any Kite. Truth and Honesty is as
scarce here as Hedges; they are seldom deceiv’d,
because they trust no Body; and Complement
is an Idleness they were never train’d
in. They shall abuse a Stranger for nothing;
and after a few base Terms scotch one another
to a Carbanado. All that help them not, they
hold popish; and take it for an Argument of
much Honesty, to rail bitterly against the King
of <em>Spain</em>. Every thing is so made to swim among
them, that it is a Question if <em>Elijah</em>’s Ax
were now floating there, whether it would be
taken for a Miracle. The Shipping is the <em>Babel</em>
which they boast on for the Glory of their Nation;
and they are in a manner all <em>Aquatiles</em>,
and therefore the <em>Spaniards</em> call them Water-Dogs.
A <em>Turkish</em> Man of War is as dreadful to
them as a Falcon to a Mallard, from whom
their best Remedy is to steal away; and Sailors
among ’em, are as common as Beggars with us,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
besides the <em>Dutch</em> Tarpaulins will drink, rail,
swear, niggle, steal, and be lousie alike. Slime,
humid Air, Water, and wet Diet, have so
bagg’d their Cheeks, that some would take
their Paunches to be gotten above their Chins;
and bring under a democratical Government,
tell them of a King in Jest, and they will cut
your Throat in Earnest; for they hate the
Name of Majesty more than a <em>Jew</em> doth Images,
a Woman pure Virtue, or a Nonconformist a
Surplice; and it is reported that there is but
a Sheet of Paper betwixt <em>Rotterdam</em> and Hell,
which is a nearer Way to old Nick than by
<em>Rochester</em>.</p>

<p>From <em>Rotterdam</em> I went to <em>Delf</em>, where I observ’d
that every <em>Mynheer</em> shall walk the Streets
as Usurers go to Bawdy-Houses, all alone and
melancholly; and their Apparel is civil enough,
but very uncomely, as having usually more
Stuff than Shape. <em>Holland</em> is the Fair of all
Sects, where all the Pedlars of Heresies have
Leave to vent their Toys, their Ribbands, and
fanatick Rattles. They will admit of all Religions
but the true one; and whosoever disturbs
the civil Government shall be liable to
Punishment, but the Decrees of Heaven and
Sanctions of Deity, any one may break uncheck’d,
by professing what false Religion he
pleases. The Men are cladded tolerably well,
unless he inclines to the Sea-Fashion; and then
are his Breeches yawning at the Knees, as if
they were about to swallow up his Legs. The
<em>Dutch</em> Women have much more Forehead than
Face; and they are starch’d so blue, that if
they once grow old, you would verily believe
you saw <em>Winter</em> walking up to the Neck in Indigo;
They are far from going naked, for of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
whole Woman you can see but half a Face; her
Hand shews her to be a sore Labourer; and if
you look lower, she’s like a Monkey chain’d about
the Middle, and had rather want it in
Diet, than not have Silver Hooks to hang her
Keys in. Their Smocks are ever whiter than
their Skin; and their Gowns are fit to hide
great Bellies; but they make them shew so unhandsome,
that <em>Englishmen</em> don’t care for getting
them. Where the Women lies in, the
Ringle or Knocker of the Door does Pennance,
for it is lapped round about with Linnen, either
to show you that loud Knocking may wake
the Child, or else that for a Month her Ring is
not to be run at. For their Diet they eat
much and spend little; and when they send
out a Fleet to the <em>East-Indies</em>, it shall live 3
Months on the Offals, which we fear would surfeit
our Swine; yet they feed on’t, and are still
the same <em>Dutchmen</em>. In their Houses, Roots
and Stockfish are staple Commodities; and if
they make a Feast, and add Flesh, they have an
Art to keep it hot more Days, than a dirty,
dingy, greasie Cook a Pig’s Head in <em>Pye-Corner</em>.</p>

<p>The <em>Dutch</em> Women are delivered, together
with their Children, of a <em>Sooterkin</em>, not unlike
to a Rat, which some imagine to be the Offspring
of the Stoves they have betwixt their
Legs in Winter. Their Fairs are more frequented
on <em>Sundays</em> in the Afternoon, than their
Churches in the Forenoon; and they are furnish’d
with such a wonderful Plenty of Corn by
their Neighbours; that they have not only enough
for their own Use, but also to export
sufficiently to other Countries, by selling them
at an extravagant Price a Pig of their own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
Sow. There is no Nation in the World whose
Seas yield the like constant and general Benefit
as our Seas do; wherefore the Sloth of the <em>English</em>
may very well be blam’d, for suffering the
<em>Dutch</em> under their Noses, to rob them of that
Wealth, which would be theirs at the small
Rate of an easie Industry. But tho’ all the Commodities
they have either domestick or foreign,
their fishing in our Seas brings them in the
greatest Profit, yet have they another Commodity
which is very profitable to them, and that
is War; for whereas other Nations are undone
by it, they have the Secret to thrive, and grow
exceeding rich by it. The Innholders paying
as much for the Excise of Victuals and Drink,
as they did at first for the Thing, it makes the
<em>Entrata</em> or Revenue of those High and Mighty
States (who, when they implor’d Queen <em>Elizabeth</em>’s
Aid, writ themselves the poor, distressed
States of <em>Holland</em>) very considerable. This free
State entertaining all Renegadoes, it is the common
Sink of Villany; each Faction calls itself
a Church; and every new-fangled, giddy-headed,
enthusiastical Botcher, Cobler, or Tinker, is
able enough to sow Sedition: But the general
Religion here is <em>Calvanism</em>, the Profession whereof,
tho’ fatal to Monarchical Government, agrees
well enough with the Parity of free States,
where the People have so much Voice and Authority.</p>

<p><em>Holland</em>, with the 16 other Provinces is call’d
the <em>Low-Countries</em>, and the <em>Netherlands</em>, from
their low Situation. Here live almost as many,
if not more, <em>Jews</em>, <em>Anabaptists</em>, <em>Socinians</em>, and
<em>Papists</em>, as <em>Calvanists</em>; so that a Traveller who
comes hither, need not want a Religion to
choose which shall best please him. Whilst I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
was in <em>Rotterdam</em>, being one Night in Company
with some of the <em>Dutch</em> Boors, who were extolling
<em>Erasmus</em>, who was born in that Town,
for the greatest Scholar the World ever bred,
my Blood broil’d at their Insolence, as knowing
<em>England</em>, and other Nations have produc’d Men
of better Learning, but they being too many
for me to resent it, I had no other Way to vent
my Resentment, but by writing the following
Lines, which I privately stuck upon his Effigies
cast in Brass, and erected not far from the
House where he was born.</p>

<p>But the high and mighty States being affronted
at this Lampoon put upon their chief Priest,
a Proclamation was issued forth, promising the
Reward of 500 Guilders for apprehending the
Author of it; whereupon I fled to <em>Delph</em> in the
twinckling of a Bed-Staff. This is a pretty
round compacted Town, about 2 Miles in Circumference,
fortified with a strong Wall and
Ditch, but after an old Fashion; and is the
great Magazine and Armory of the Commonwealth,
which is democratical, as I said before,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
for Monarchy they abhor as much as a <em>Scotchman</em>
does <em>Episcopacy</em>, or a true bred <em>Irishman</em> paying
Allegiance to a <em>Protestant</em> Prince.</p>

<p>From <em>Delph</em> I went to the <em>Hague</em>, the Metropolis
of <em>Holland</em>, not for Trade, but for the
States assembling at this Place, which is round
compacted, and neatly built: It is neither
Town nor City, but call’d a Village, as being
unwall’d, and is reckon’d the biggest in the
World. Within half a League of this Place
lies interr’d in an Abby <em>Margaret</em> Countess of
<em>Henenberg</em>, Sister to <em>William</em>, King of the <em>Romans</em>,
and on her Tomb still remains an Epitaph,
which mentions, that she brought forth as
many Children at one Birth, as are Days in the
Year. The Country has few Trees in it, because
the Ground is so waterish and soft, that
it is not able to bear the Weight of one; and
for the same Reason a less Quantity of Fruit
and Grain grows in it.</p>

<p>Their chiefest Fuel is Turf, of which they
burn so much, that it may be very well thought
the <em>Dutch</em> will burn up their own Land before
the Day of Judgment They are so cumbred
about the Affairs and Business of this World,
that their Ignorance in Religion is unaccountable.
The Theological Terms of Regeneration,
Consubstantiality, Predestination, Justification,
Sanctification, or hypostatical Union,
are full as mysterious to them, as the intricate
Hierogliphics of the antient <em>Egyptians</em> were to
the Vulgar. ’Tis true, they nevertheless keep
the <em>Sabbath-Day</em> very strict, for all the while
that divine Service in their blind way holas,
they do no manner of Work but wash in the open
Streets, keep Shops almost open, angle,
sing, play on the Musick, dance, drink, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
whore; for as six Days are tiresome to be at
hard Labour, their high Mightinesses allow the
People one Day in seven to go to the Devil with
Pleasure. In five, the <em>Dutch</em> are good for nothing
but to be serv’d as a Sultan or Grand
Seignior once advis’d a French King, which
advice was to send an Army of Pioneers to dig
up their Country, and throw all the Inhabitants
at once into the Sea.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
